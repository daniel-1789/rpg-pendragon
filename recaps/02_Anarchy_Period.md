## Year 496 - Chapter XVI - The Saxon Kings

After the treachery of the Infamous Feast, the land of Logres was without a king. Countess Ellen, ruling in the place of her young son Robert, summoned her most loyal knights to advise her. Joining Arthen, Boudica, and Mag was Sir Percy, former squire of the fallen Adric. Adric’s firstborn son accompanied him as squire.

Prince Aescwine of Essex had come to demand tribute on behalf of his father. A courier from Ulfius, who was still recovering from the Battle of Saint Albans, spoke of a sword which had appeared in London - supposedly whomever could draw it from its stone would be king. Sir Brastias dismissed that as nonsense - he couldn’t draw the sword.

In their councils with the countess Sir Percy was the strongest advocate of not paying tribute. Instead they would build new stone walls around Sarum - first around the castle, then around the city itself. The knights, having been somewhat successful in previous years in obtaining plunder helped finance the walls - and that summer they bravely led a defense of Sarum when raiders from Essex attacked, trying to sabotage the construction.

In the autumn, the Saxon King Cerdic conquered the land of Hampshire to the south of Salisbury. His son, Cynric, a handsome young knight, asked that the countess send knights to treat with his father, remaining as a hostage to their safety.

King Cerdic was surprisingly cultured and claimed to be a fellow Briton - yes, a Briton, for his father was once the high king, King Vortigern, who was eventually defeated by Uther’s brother, Ambrosius Aurelianus. Would they not advise the countess to pledge her allegiance to him? There would be many wars to come and he would reward his loyal subjects. He advised them to think it over.

They advised Countess Ellen to delay as long as she could - Arthen recounted rumors of bastard children of Uther and Madoc - if one could be found, perhaps he could be named King of Logres.

The winter in Salisbury was more prosperous than other lands in Logres, for the Countess had refused tribute to Essex and her castle’s new stone walls gave her subjects a sanctuary. It would be four more years until the entire city could be protected.

## Year 497 - Chapter XVII - Double Tribute

Countess Ellen had two Aethelings at court in Sarum, where work had begun on the outer stone walls, being constructed by the stonemason Cuthbert. Aescwine of Essex was present on behalf of his father, Aethelswith, and Cynric of Wessex on behalf of his father, Cerdic. Both demanded tribute. 

Throughout the land powerful lords were making moves. The lord of the Isle of Wight had refused tribute to Wessex and had been slain in Cerdic’s conquest of the island. Tintagel had fallen and paid homage to Idres, King of Cornwall and Brittany. Duke Ulfius visited and told the countess that his land of Silchster would ally with Kine Ælle of Sussex and advised her to do the same with Salisbury. 
  
Ellen felt she could ignore Ælle for the time being, as he had not yet demanded tribute. However, she did not feel they could fend off both Essex and Wessex. She was counseled by her knights. Two of her most senior were present - Lady Boudica and Sir Mag. Also present were Sir Percy, the former squire of Sir Adric, and Sir Beornwulf ap Aethelred, kindred of Sir Arthen.

They were also interested in pursuing rumors of a son of Prince Madoc. Rumor had it that the King of the Sauvage Forest might know something, but they did not know a way in. However, a way presented it, for Merlin made a rare appearance at court - he was a most unwelcome sight to most, given he had seized Uther’s infant heir. He told them there was a young scholar, Pertoines, captured by Saxons of Essex. The scholar had been en route to Oxford, on the border of the forest - he would likely be able to help them. Merlin also pointed out they would be carrying plunder. The four knights advised Ellen to pay tribute to Wessex but not Essex - they would raid the Essex Saxons, rescue Petroines, and seize the plunder to pay for the tribute to Wessex.

They did battle with the Saxons along a small river. In the end, the knights and their forces prevailed. They captured many Saxons and Mag slew the Knight of Tusks. They seized the plunder and sent it to Countess Ellen while they escorted young Pertoines to Oxford where he founded a small university.

## Year 498 - Chapter XVIII - Into the Sauvage Forest
![Forest Sauvage][image-3]
The challenges from the Saxon kings surrounding Salisbury continued. In addition to Aescwine of Essex present on behalf of his father, Aethelswith; and Cynric of Wessex on behalf of his father, Cerdic, there was Celyn of Sussex. They could not afford to pay all three and they lacked the resources to fight them. The good knights advised Countess Ellen to accept Cerdic’s offer of alliance short of accepting him as liege, greatly reducing the cost of tribute. He had promised he would protect the land from other Saxons - and it was clear the three Saxon lords did not care for one another. They would put that to the test. This did put them allying with a different Saxon than Duke Ulfius - though alliances with Saxons were not likely to be enduring.

Merlin again appeared at court, indicating he would be leaving Britain for the continent and the knights agreed to escort him to the port of Dorchester. This proved dangerous as Queen Ygraine sent a group of her knights to take vengeance on Merlin for his role in abducting her son. The knights of Salisbury did slay their leader Sir Roy of Rôls and took three more knights as prisoner - lessening the impact of the tribute to Cerdic and allowing construction to continue on the stone walls around Saurum, reaching half completion that summer.

As high summer approached they visited Pertoines of Oxford who showed them the entrance to the Sauvage Forest. They entered, hoping to find Madog, King of Sauvage - with information both on Beornwulf and on any possible heirs of Madoc. They ran into the Wild Hunt whose lord did take them to Madog in return for their joining him on the hunt for a great elephant. The wild King Madog was thrilled to have guests and provided them with some assistance, though at a price. He did tall them that Madoc did indeed have an hair, one lost to the faerie realm - if they wandered the forest  for years they might find him. But he advised them not to, as there was another heir of Uther’s whom they would indeed find, far sooner than they might find an heir of Madoc’s - and would not a legitimate heir be preferable? He did return Beornwulf’s infant son. They had to pay two prices. First, the child would be given a faerie godmother - the boy would, he prophesied, not grow to be a Christian but would follow the old ways. The other was a promise he asked of all the knights - that should they encounter the legendary Questing Beast, that they would sound horns he gave them to summon both him and the master of the Wild Hunt.

With those promises made, they quickly found their way out of the forest. It seemed a dream, but for the horns they now had and the return of Beornwulf’s son. They’d not be able to find Madog again without aid…

## Year 499 - Chapter XIX -The Oxford Usurpers
![Rydychan][image-4]

Court at Sarum was tense, with Prince Mark and Prince Cynric of Wessex both present. Prince Mark urged the countess to break her alliance with Wessex, though on the advice of her loyal knights, she kept the alliance with Wessex - hoping the rivalry between the Saxon kings would break out into open warfare. 

With things relatively peaceful in Salisbury, Beornwulf, Boudica, Mag, and Percy rode north to Rydychan Country. There the twice-widowed Countess of Rydychan was looking for assistance in reclaiming her father’s land from a trio of brothers who has broken their oaths to Rydychan, taking Oxford, Wallingford, and Shriburn for themselves. Marching north with household knights and peasant levies, they besieged Wallingford, stopping Sir Basile from sending riders to summon his younger brothers to his side. Breaching the outer Bailey, Sir Basile fell in battle to them. However, the campaign had been long and the forces at Oxford and Shriburn outnumbered theirs and they would have to wait another season.

### Winter 499-500
The harvest that year was wealthy, bolstered by some of the plunder from the summer campaign.

## Year 500 - Chapter XX -The Unseelie of Oxford
![Britain Events 496-500][image-5]

At court in Sarum, the Princes of Sussex and Kent attended, scowling at each otters. There was apparently an offer of marriage to Countess Ellen from Cornwall, one which she had rejected.

War continued throughout the land, with a Saxon fleet sailing up the Yar River to sack Yarmouth. The Duke of Caercolun marched his army to battle, but the but his army was butchered. The Saxons assaulted Norwich, then starved out Buckenham and Thetford. They occupied those larger cities, and groups of Saxon warriors wandered the countryside, robbing and killing. Many refugees fled and became thralls of the Saxons. Their King Cwichelm claimed not to be Saxons but rather Angles. The difference was lost on the people of England.

King Idres besieged Dorchester. Cornwall withdrew before conquering anything more significant, giving Praetor Jonathan a victory for stopping the Cornish, the first to do so.

King Ælle’s warriors from Sussex and the Jutes of Kent battled each other in the Perdue Forest. 
King Nanteleod of Escavion won a small battle against the king of Byrcheinoig and gained his vassalage. The join forces then marched west and attacked the Irish in Estregales, defeating them and gaining their vassalage.

King Ælle of Sussex and Aetherelswith of Essex offered generous terms if Ellen would provide them with mercenary knights. King Cerdic eschewed the niceties of alliance and again demanded tribute of Salisbury. With little choice, Countess Ellen agreed to pay Cerdic while her loyal knights adventured again in Rydychan County. They had intended on marching on Sir Begetting of Wallingford but Bede’s brother, Sir Belus of Oxford, had made an alliance with the faerie. The alliance had gone poorly and he found himself with ringing bells on his feet and an elongated nose. He begged Ellen’s knights, Beornwulf, Boudica, Mag, and Percy for their aid against the faerie host. Oxford was defended by a strange array of faerie, led by Prince Charming. They battled skeletons, giants, and all sorts of weird beings but eventually saw, running across the field of battle, the Questing Beast. True to their promise to the Master of the Hunt, they sounded their horns and pursued the Beast as part of the Wild Hunt. There was much chaos but in the end the Beast was captured by the Master of the Hunt and Oxford and Wallingford yielded back to the Countess of Rydychan, with the lands of Wallingford, Oxford, and Shriburn to be managed by Ellen’s knights.

### Winter 500-501
With plunder the knights were able to keep at least a modest style of living in Logres.

## Year 501 - Chapter XXI -The Wedding of Morgan

![Britain Year 501 Events][image-6]


War continued, year after year. Saxons demanded tributes, along with the Angles. Both King Cerdic of Wessex and King Ælle of Sussex were demanding tribute. The intrigue at court was Cerdic was vulnerable so Countess Ellen's loyal knights advised they pay only Ælle. This advice was well chosen as a small fleet of Saxons invaded Wessex, led by their chieftain, Port. Cerdic yielded land to Port, who renamed one of the cities after himself, Portsmouth.

Huntington and Hertford tried to hire mercenaries to protect themselves from the Angles but this effort was in vain, with both failing.

A Saxon band attempted to kidnap Queen Ygraine, Uther's widow. Countess Ellen dispatched her loyal knights to intervene. Given their former history, they were not inclined towards speed. However, when they did arrive at the nunnery at Amesbury they found Morgan surrounded by dead Saxons. "They were careless," Morgan informed them.

Queen Ygraine had agreed to wed her young daughter to King Urien. Countess Ellen assigned her knights to escort Ygraine and Morgan to Gaiholm castle, just north of Hardian's wall. After the wedding Ygraine decided to stay with her daughter. Traveling back to Logres, the knights were ambushed by Picts who had been at the wedding feast. It was not certain the Picts had been sent by Ygraine. But it was likely...

## Year 502 - Chapter XXII - The Tower of the Headless Dead
Some of the local leaders had begun consolidating power. Gloucester, Orofoise, Galvoise, Chesire, Cameliard, and Wuerensis had all submitted to King Nantleod. Duke Corneus of Lindsey now ruled over Bedegraine and Lambor and claimed Cameliard, making war between the two likely. The king of the Angles claimed dominion over all of Britain, a claim he was far from being able to enforce. Duke UIlfius was urging his neighbors to be neutral and form an alliance for self-defense, proposing that Silchester, Rydychan, and Salisbury band together. 

That summer, Beornwulf, Boudica, Mag, and Percy investigated reports of the dead walking in an area known as the Forest of Skulls, near London and Hertford. A visit to a nearby village confirmed the threat - some miles away a sorcerer had set up residence in a tower and had been animating headless corpses - one of whom attacked that night, wounding Beornwulf.

The next morning they investigated and received ominous warning from skulls along the forest path to turn around. Reaching a clearing, they found the tower - and it was surrounded by animated headless corpses - not just of men but of giants as well. Far too many for them to face themselves.

Withdrawing, the knights worked with their allies and kinfolk. Ulfius agreed to send troops and even the Saxons of Wessex under King Cerdic participated. Leading the army, they stormed their way across the clearing, with Mag wounded by a giant - the skeleton of a giant. Limping into the tower, they found the sinister sorcerer behind the undead - a man they would later learn was named Guidgen. Assisted by headless skeletons and his magic he proved a devastating foe. His illusions made it hard to strike him true, Mag missing many blows. When he finally landed one, a jeweled talisman glowed an ugly red and absorbed the wound. Guidgen enchanted a sword to attack the knights. With all of them wounded badly, Boudica made a desperate lunge at him, tearing the talisman off his throat as his enchanted sword landed a killing blow on her. However, the other knights were finally able to finish him off and with that, the dead slept forever. The knights needed much healing after this grave battle, after which they returned Boudica's body to Salisbury for burial.

Sir Mag, the eldest living companion of the late Boudica, knighted her daughter Calliope, as part of the Easter feast in Sarum.

Sir Ulfius warned the court in Saurum of the impending Saxon threat to London. “Two Saxon kingdoms are mustering to attack. Kent and Essex are going to plunder to collect riches and Glory. They will of course come up the Thames River again, and perhaps try to attack London. We need you to stand by us and crush them.” 

Sir Lane of Lindsey had his own request for aid: “We need your help. The duke says he is threatened on three sides by foes. We expect to be attacked by Gales and Malahaut and by the Angles this year.” 

Meanwhile, Cynric, son of Cerdic came armed with threats. “We are not foolish enough to wish for a battle, but we'll extract our tribute in plunder if need be.

In consultation with her knights, Countess Ellen chose to hold off tribute, sending some of her knights to aid Ulfius in defense of the Thames while the remainder of the knights stayed to defend Sarum from the likely attack from Wessex.

Beornwulf, Calliope, Mag, and Percy led the contingent of knights from Salisbury to London. 

King Aesc of Kent and King Aethelswith of Essex both marched out with their armies. They stopped and besieged London, one army on each side of the river. Ulfius crossed the Thames at Windsor, attempting to attack the northern army of Essex before they could be joined by those from Kent. The troops from Salisbury marched on the troops from Kent, south of the Thames.

Unknown to Ulfius, a small fleet of boats ferried the Kentsmen across the river at night. Ulfius was greatly out-numbered, and had heard that Saxon ships had sailed for Windsor to block his retreat. He fought a short battle, and then escaped with his army at night. 

The next morning the Saxons besieged London, using siege equipment provided by the mercenary knight Sir Helier. The forces of Salisbury fought valiantly, but left alone, they were outflanked and the city opened its gates. Sir Percy was badly wounded in the battle. To blunt their victory, Sir Mag launched balls of flaming pitch into the city, putting much of the city to the torch (and roasting marsh mallow plants in the process). They then retreated back to Salisbury.

## Year 504 - Chapter XXIV - The Redcap Tower
![Britain Year 503-504 Events][image-7]



News The King of Somerset had sent a herald to ask for help in fighting against King Idres. 

The countess however was interested if her brave knights could secure a tower near the border with Wessex. 

Beornwulf, Calliope, Mag, and Percy traveled to the vicinity of the tower and learned it was largely in ruins from a nearby village. However, the villagers feared a vile Redcap which dwelt there. They did battle with the Redcap but were badly wounded and retreated back to the village, Mag previously injured. The village surgeon tried to treat him but his wounds festered and he fell. He was avenged in battle against the Redcap, which followed them to the village and was at last defeated by force of arms and Percy finally being able to work an exorcism ritual to banish the foul fey from our realm.

## Year 505 - Chapter XXV - The Battle of Hertford

Prince Cynric arrived to make his annual threats. However, King Nanteleod had sent his own emissaries, Sirs Lak and Alain, who came proposing war against the Saxons, preparing their army and Lindsey's for battle against Essex and Angles.

Countess Ellen agreed to the plan and sent Calliope, along with three new knights' to represent her and her son, Robert. They were, Heckle, son of Adric; Leofric ap Arthen	, and Máel-dúin "Maul" O Hanlon, nephew of Mag.

King Cerdic marched north against Salisbury. With him was King Port, but Ælle was notably missing. The countess ordered her people to the safety of the castles and now-walled city, and ordered her army inside, sending the knights northward to wait at Wandborough.

The Saxons burned and pillaged everywhere, but found little to eat. 

They laid siege to Sarum. King Nanteleod’s army moved south. It entered Wandborough, where the king welcomed the Salisbury knights to his army. They moved south towards Sarum. King Cerdic raised the siege and marched north. They fought and drove off Cerdic's army, the knights of Salisbury acquiting themselves well.

Nanteleod moved his army east. This allowed Cerdic to escape but Nanteleod to join his forces with those of Duke Ulfius. They fought another, inconclusive battle with King Cerdic, who retreated home after the battle.

Though the forty days of military service had expired, Nanteleod convinced many, including the Knights of Salisbury, to continue the campaign at their own expense. They pressed on, marching into the Saxon territory of Essex, destroying the Essex armies. Then King Aethelswith of Anglia arrived with the full force of his army. He was defeated outside Hertford, with the knights of Salisbury taking him prisoner.

Much pillage was taken and there was much rejoicing.

## Year 506 - Chapter XXV - The Adventure of the Deceitful Faerie

Though Nanteleod was looking for aid in his battles this summer, our heroic knights investigated the village of Steamford, plagued by a deceitful faerie. After investigation, and dealing with peasant lying and backstabbing, they slew the Faerie Tad. This proved to be a mistake, as he came back at midnight to plague them. They found a portal to the fey lands on a lake island and were eventually able to capture Tad and take him back to his land where his lord, Ratatouilles the Redcap, swore he would face justice. They feasted with the fey - a feast none could remember, and found a week had passed for their one night with the faerie.

## Year 507 - Chapter XXVI - The Liberations of Somerset and London

Tension was high in Sarum. Prince Mark and Prince Alain de Carilion bickered. Reports of raids by Picts in the north became common. Apparently Countess Ellen was entertaining the possibility of a marriage alliance with King Nanteleod. 

While Duke Corneus of Lindsey planned to march on London, Ellen's knights joined with Nanteleod's army to liberate Somerset. They rendezvoused with the King of Somerset (in exile) in the swamps, facing brigands who had once been soldiers of Uther, con xdhfc-vincing them to join Nanteleod's army to restore them to the protection of the law. They then led armies to retake the city of Bath, though King Idres refused to be drawn into battle. Heckle was badly wounded in the battle but survived his time on the surgeon's table.

London was successfully liberated though Salisbury was badly raided by Saxons.

## Year 508 - Chapter XXVII- The Fall of King Nanteleod

Shortly after Easter there were great festivities. In a marriage alliance, the Countess Ellen and King Nanteleod were married. At the wedding feast, Calliope and Heckle were near the head table, though all were welcomed and celebrated.

After that the knights went to war with Nanteleod. At long last the British would crush the Saxon King Cerdic. The Collegium would again be meeting, and many felt that Nanteleod would be named Pendragon, King of all the Britains.

They met Cerdic’s forces at Netley Marsh. However, the British forces were betrayed. Allied with Cerdic were the troops of King Ælle as well as Cornish knights led by Prince Mark. Outnumbered, the forces of Nanteleod and Salisbury fought bravely. In the end, an ambush from the rear, led by Prince Cynric, son of Cerdic, defeated and slew Nanteleod. Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul led the survivors in as organized a retreat as they could, to reinforce Salisbury from the imminent Saxon raids and inform the now-twice widowed Ellen of the defeat.
