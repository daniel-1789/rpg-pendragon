## Year 558 - Chapter LXXXII - The Attack of Carduel
Sir Mordred and his kin were at Lothian, having blood tournaments. However, they seemed not to be defending their realms.. Beta. John, Lewys, and Maug sailed north to investigate and  reports that King Brian, nominally owing fealty to Arthur, was leading a fleet of French and Saxon ships against Lothian and surrounding lands. 
  
They did battle with such ships. Though King Brian escaped, John slew a son of the Saxon King Caelin, Cynical. They protected some towns on the coast but King Brian had too many ships to completely stop them without aid from Mordred. They eventually confronted Mordred who belatedly dispatched his own troops, long after they’d have done any good. Having made Mordred look foolish, they may have made an enemy…

## Year 559 - Chapter LXXXIII - The Blasphemy at Yarmouth

Hearing reports of Saxon attacks near Yarmouth, Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug rode north with their forces. While the land was indeed under attack, Yarmouth itself was protected - by undead knights, led by the deceased Sir Kay, foster brother of Arthur. 

Sir Kay attempted to recruit them, telling them the tale of how Galahad had been brought bodily to heaven by the Grail which had been entrusted to Sir Mordred, who pledged his loyalty to the Grail. Mordred used this power to bring back the dead, with so many knights having fallen in pursuit of the Grail.

A priest showed them the arrangement, with the Grail in a large baptismal font. The water had clearly been corrupted. Detecting the blasphemy, the knights drew their weapons - and saw the priest was a demon. They battled the demon and Sir Kay, closing the doors to prevent more undead. Eventually Sir John was able to extract the Grail from the unholy water and purify it, ending its power. The undead knights collapsed. They could not celebrate long as they had to rally Yarmouth’s living defenders to stop the nearby Saxons from attacking.

## Year 560 - Chapter LXXXIV - Tale of the Spectre King

In the year 470, the Pendragon Aurelius Ambrosius defeated the Saxon King Hengist. After the battle, Eldaldus, Bishop of Gloucester and Duke Eldol of Gloucester’s  brother, condemned Hengist thusly:
> Even if you all were doing your level best to have this man set free, I would hack him in pieces myself. In this, I would be following the prophet Samuel,  who, when he held in his power Agag, King of Amalek, hewed him in pieces, saying: 'As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women.' Do. therefore,the same with this man, who is clearly a second Agag.

> With that, Eldol beheaded Hengist with his sword. Aurelius was respectful enough of the Saxon to have his body buried in the pagan fashion and ordered his men inter the body under a barrow of earth. Such was the end of King Hengist. 

That is, until recently. On the day Mordred, or so it is told, corrupted the Grail, Hengist reanimated. And every Wednesday he appeared in the lands of King Eifon, staying until he slew at least one person. He slayed knights. The king’s youngest son. Two monks who held him at bay briefly with a prayer.

Losing so many knights gave King Brian opportunity to attack the land around the Abbey of La Beale Adventure.

It was to this sad land Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug arrived. They met with the king and his son Prince Endor. They investigated and learned much, especially that the monks had come the closest to defeating the specter king.  The monk’s guardian Sir Colbert saw the spectre king briefly stopped by a prayer. He tried to defend them but fell in battle himself, losing an eye. 

Knowing the monks came from the Abbey they made plans to ride thence. However it was a long journey and they might not make it in time for the spectre king’s next Wednesday. Sir Guieth accused them of cowardice. Bela demanded he defend such words and they did battle for love, Bela easily unhorsing him.

At the abbey they learned of the spectre king’s origin and that the prayer the monks used was part of what was needed to destroy it - they would also need the sword used to slay his mortal life. It was said that the crazy hermit Vortimer had it. Lewys rode back to Eifon with this information while the rest sought Vortimer.

Finding Vortimer,  he told how he was a child when he witnessed the slaying of Hengist. He did indeed collect the sword for he knew it would be needed again but King Eifon had banished him for scaring the peasants with his frightening tales.

Returning with the sword they arrived just in time to do battle with the spectre king. The battle was brutal, with John nearly being slain by the undead Saxon. Bela next took up the sword, with Sir Guieth unhorsing the spectre king and allowing them at last to put it to rest.

## Year 561 - Chapter LXXXV - The Battle of Pembroke Castle

Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug had traveled west to protect Pembroke from the attacks of King Brian. They proved successful, even though he had taken to using unsightly weapons such as a floating balloon. 

However, the four heard disturbing tales that all was not well at Camelot. The Queen had been accused of murder by poison and needed a champion to protect her from being executed by burning. Though apparently Lancelot swept in to save the day, they were still involved when then actual poisoner, Sir Pionel, and his patron, Morgan le Fey, arrived at Pembroke. They learned Gawaine had been the original target, for she was seeking revenge for the death of her sister, Queen Margawse, which she blamed on Margawse’s sons. 

Bela tried using connections of family to talk down her great aunt but she would hear nothing of it. They were able to overcome the two, breaking Morgan’s staff.  Morgan’s magic was weaker than it had once been, the connection to the fey realm at an ebb since the finding of the Grail.  They brought the two back to Camelot to face the King’s justice. Pionel was executed immediately while Morgan imprisoned in a tower while her request to retire to a convent was considered.

## Year 562 - Chapter LXXXVI - The Last Road to Avalon

While rumors stirred of Sir Mordred alleging an affair between Lancelot and the Queen (though he still not dare utter them in open court), Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug met with Morgan le Fey in her tower in Camelot. She provided them with a drug that might allow them to learn the location of Lewys’ lost son. 
  
That night the four shared a dream. They heard a voice they’d not heard before, but their ancestors had - it was the voice of Merlin, a voice unheard in the waking world for decades.  He told them to hunt the white stag on the Feast of Saint Eustace, to follow it into the faerie realm, one of the last ways into that realm, where they would find the missing boy.

Doing so that September they did indeed find themselves in that realm. The stag told them the boy had been captured by a hag. Coming to a clearing they found the hag’s cottage and a furious Lewys, seeing his son, though now a lad of 16, not 10, chained to the cottage, burst through the door and slew the hag.

The stag told them they would need to follow the road to its end. He told them their next destination was the kingdom of Talc Mochyn and they would want to acquire their spear - unknown to them a boar-slaying spear. It would help them along the road but he warned them it would be dangerous to take back to their realm. He gave them an acorn banner to show them friendship.

They found knights of this realm, seeing them to be walking boars. They bathed in the mud baths provided by the king and bribed some boars for acorns to present at the feast. At the feast, Lewys the Huge wrestled a boar knight and gained the spear.

The last stop on the road was of the giant Gwaet. He hurled rocks at them, swearing he would protect his beloved. It turned out she was a human woman he had abducted decades ago. They fought their way into the tower and slew the giant. They found his “wife”, Taryan of Penyt, deceased decades. They took her heirlooms with her and found their way back to their realm, bringing news of Taryan to Penyt.

## Year 563 - Chapter LXXXVII - The Sundering
To be fair, Lewys tried to warn his lord Arthur that Mordred was saying bad things.

At a feast in Carlisle…. Late one evening, after the de Ganis clan had left, as the drinks were long and the talk had become hasty, the conversation of Agravaine and Mordred got loud enough to be overheard, and interesting enough to listen to. 

“Someone must speak the truth,” said Mordred. 

A lull fell over the crowd. Even the king is listening. 

“I will,” said Sir Agravaine, “for the love of my uncle and the good name of our family.”

“And what,” asked the king, “will you tell me?”

“That your wife, the queen, is having an affair with Sir Lancelot.” 

With that, the fragile unity that had been Arthur’s court was no more. When called out, Lancelot escaped the castle, slaying many of the Orkney clan and wounding Mordred.  He claimed his innocence but it did to help he was in the Queen’s chambers.

The Queen was ordered to be burned at the stake the next day. Though that day Lancelot returned with many of the de Ganis. He escaped with the Queen. 

Arthur led his troops to beseige Lancelot’s castle, Joyous Gard. Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug fought beside Arthur as Round Table knight battled Round Table knight. Eventually a legate from the Pope intervened, ordering a peace between Arthur’s forces and for Arthur to take his wife back. He was inclined to agree but Gawaine, with all the Orkney blood shed, refused the second term.

However, Lancelot did agree to return the Queen, after which he was banished from the realm. 

At Gawaine’s urging Arthur made preparation for war in France, to which the de Ganis clan had fled.

That winter Bela and her wife, Morgana, great-granddaughter of Boudica of Uther’s Court, sent the remainder of their peasants through the portal to faerie, believing the end had home. They and their eldest children remained to honor their oaths to the king.
