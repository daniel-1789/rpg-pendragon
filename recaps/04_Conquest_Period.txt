![Britain_519][image-2]
The year of our Lord 519 saw rebellion in Anglia and a combined Pict and Irish invasion in Alcuid. Arthur marched north to Alcuid to deal with an invasion to his realm while Duke Hervis relentlessly clamped down on the rebellion. News from France told a sad tale of the conquest of Ganis, with no lords or heirs surviving.

The veteran knights Calliope and Heckle accompanied Arthur, along with the younger knights Axel and Elcard. There they helped break the siege of Alcuid and pursued the attacking Picts back to their own land, retreating to the islands of Loch Lomond. A Christian monk persuaded Arthur to have mercy so he could convert the pagan Picts and so redeem their heathen souls.
