## Uther Period 
### Year 480 Adventure

Let us introduce our knights and discuss what transpired in the Year of our Lord 480.


*   Adric, Lord of Steeple Langford. British Christian of Salisbury.
*   Arthen ap Melfyn, Lord of Winterbourne Gunnet. British Christian of Salisbury.
*   Boudica, Lady of Tisbury . Eldest surviving heir of father with no surviving brother. Taken up the sword. British Pagan of Salisbury.
*   Mag o Hanlon, Lord of Winterbourne Stoke. Irish Pagan, originally from Estregales, family. Father given grant of land by High King Aurelius.

We played the introductory Pendragon adventure, though we moved it a few years back in time to the year 580. At the start of the scenario, the four PCs were all squires on the verge of knighthood being trained by Sir Elad, castellan of Vagon Castle and marshal to Earl Roderick of Salisbury. At the castle, they practiced on quintains and engaged in a horse race – won by Mag, though everyone else fell off in the race. Elad wished them to joust to determine who would lead an investigation into the peasants’ reports of a killer bear—in the brief mini-tourney that followed, Adric unhorsed Mag and Arthen unhorsed Boudica. In the final joust, Arthen emerged triumphantly. They left promptly to the village of Imber, staying with the priest “Old Garr”. They quickly discerned the going-on-elderly priest was not quite living up to his vow of chastity but was otherwise a gracious host who put them in the right direction to find the bear. The next morning, after some exploring they found and defeated the bear—Arthen and Mag saving parts of the bear for clothing, As they began their return to Vagon Castle they came upon four bandits on foot harassing one of the Earl’s peasants. They quickly met out justice, slaying one and capturing three. From Vagon Castle they traveled to Sarum, capital of Salisbury. It was there that, nominated by Sir Elad, the four were to be knighted by Earl Roderick. They stood holy vigil—a sacred act for the Christians Adric and Arthen, not so much for Boudica and Mag, both pagans. Boudica, not particularly caring, promptly got a good night’s sleep. Arthen had wished to stay up in vigil the whole night, but the action caught up with him and he too slept. Mag, though not a believer, stayed up with Adric. The next morning the four were knighted, beginning with Adric. At a feast,there was much discussion. The pagans found themselves a bit below the salt of the feast while Arthen was at the Earl’s table, Adric somewhat closer. All of them caught much gossip. They learned the Earl had just returned from fighting with the High King Aurelius at the Battle of Salisbury—where the High King was killed by treachery—poisoned by his traitorous physician on behalf of the invading Saxons. Fortunately, the Saxon army was defeated. Unfortunately, while the lords of Logres proclaimed Aurelius’s brother Uther their king, the Collegium of Britain declined to name him High King. War was likely in the years to come and more knights were necessary. The newly minted knights flirted, gossiped, and otherwise celebrated, though none were successful in finding partners of their preferred genders. With the waning of summer into autumn, they returned to their manors.


#### 480 GM Notes

While the _Uther Expansion_ covered the year 480, it seemed to assume some familiarity with the rules and plunged right into mass combat. I felt that was a bit much for a first session and used the introductory adventure. I think that was a good move – it taught the players the setting and rules in stages. At the ending feast, I dropped news of what had befallen King Aurelius and Uther’s ascension to the throne—but not as High King.


#### 480-481 Winter Highlights

To be honest, I was always a little bit fuzzy as to what “year” a winter phase takes place in. By medieval calendars the new year often did not begin until the spring—i.e one day in March might be the year 480 and then the next day might be in the year 481. All four were married that summer. Adric and Mag found wives, Nyssa and Timothea. Arthen and Boudica found husbands—sons of knights. Boudica married Sir Fegrus, Arthen Sir Wulfric ap Aethelred. No children were on the way after that winter, though all desired heirs as soon as possible. Both Adric and Arthen lost a pair of horses that winter, though all were replaced by Earl Roderick.


### Year 481 Adventure

King Uther held his Easter court in Saurum. There was much gossip as to the Collegium not naming him High King of all the Britains. Moreover, there was anger about the King of Bedegraine not paying homage to Uther, claiming it was Auerelius Ambrosius’ due to his being High King, but no such homage was owed to Uther. In anger, Uther assembled an army to march on the King of Bedegraine. The battle was not much of a challenge for the army as a whole, but it was a challenge for our knights. Sir Mag was dispatched to see why the Duke of Cornwall was tardy and therefore joined the fighting himself midway through the battle, telling tales of the Duke being delayed by mud and rain. In the battle, Lady Boudica was badly wounded though survived without infection, fighting on longer than most would consider sane. Sir Mag was unhorsed in the fighting but continued fighting to the end as well. Sir Arthen managed to stay horsed throughout the battle. The battle ended when the King of Bedegraine engaging King Uther in single combat, dying in the process. After Boudica had healed from her injuries, Earl Roderick sent them to visit Sir Edaris, Duke of the March, and his daughter, Lady Rosalyn. Earl Roderick was looking for a suitable wife—with the young Lady Ellen, whose hand was Uther’s to decide, having been visited the previous year by other knights. They found Ellen a gracious young lady, and a notably generous woman. Roderick was pleased with their work but decided, despite Sir Edaris wanting an answer immediately, to hold off committing to Lady Ellen, saying he could not so swiftly decide on such an important matter. As plunder, they all gained 2 Librum and a rouncy as well as 45 Glory for the battle.


#### 481 GM Notes

I found the material for the year 481 a little sparse. The actual battle worked out rather well—it was my first try using the large-scale combat rules for Pendragon. Technically 480 was designed to have a battle but I chose to use the core rules introductory adventure instead given the number of Pendragon newbies we had. I found I liked the large-scale combat rules—it seemed to capture the chaos of battle well and was fairly brutal, with Boudica taking a beating—and making a successful Valorous test when her player’s inclination was to retreat… Given the sparseness of the adventure, I took the opportunity to have them help their liege, Earl Roderick, in his search for a wife.


#### 481-482 Winter Highlights

Lady Boudica gave birth to a daughter, Calliope. Also, one of her sisters went mysteriously missing that winter, paying a visit to the King of Summerland. Sir Arthen had a nephew born in his family. Sir Mag’s sister was involved in some scandalous romance. Alas, Mag’s wife Timothea gave birth to a son, but both mother and child died shortly thereafter. Sir Adric, while not having any heirs born, did have a niece born into his family.


### **Year 482 Adventure**

Court in Easter of 482 was at Linden Pool Castle. There Uther announced his plans to subjugate King Cadwy of Summerland who had refused to acknowledge his rulership or to share his mineral wealth. King Uther was in a poor move, as the King of Summerland was reputed to be a wizard - and his own wizard, Merlin, had gone missing, advising against the campaign.

Arthen, Mag, Adric, and Boudica were part of the raiding parties sent to secure the mines. They were successful in facing the soldiers protecting the mines and then went on to accompany Uther at his parley with the King of Summerland, rowing him out to a small island in the marshes of Summerland. King Uther enters the tent armed and angry, while Cadwy is unarmed and calm.

That night, Uther holds a feast for Cadwy and his barons. Uther accepts the homage of King Cadwy, names him Count Summerland, and even gives him new lands. As a token of magnanimity (or as part of the deal), Uther agreed to send our four knights to deal with a problem Cadwy had been having in the marshes - a group of Water Leapers had been plaguing travelers. Rather like a large, legless frog with finny wings, these terrifying creatures leaps from the water and glide along the surface to snatch boaters from their crafts. Cadwy also retains the King of Summerland title. Uther claims a great victory for subduing Cadwy, despite appearances.

The knights stripped off their heavier armor and went deep into the marshes to deal with the beasts. The battle was difficult, with Mag being dragged under and nearly drowning, though our heroic knights were triumphant, gaining 100 glory each.

As the year approached winter, they continued helping their liege, Earl Roderick, in his search for a wife, this time visiting Lady Llylla at Castle Vigor. Llylla was sister to Sir Ederyn, Baron of Warcastle, about a nine-day trip from Sarum. Lady Llylla was quite beautiful but also extremely cruel. Though tempted by the beauty of the lady, Roderick declined the opportunity to marry her, as his knights told of her great cruelty.


#### **Year 482-483 Winter**

Major notes:



*   Adric lost one of the rouncies in his stable.
*   Mag married the heiress of a vassal knight, Lady Bryn. gaining two manors and 9 Librum, as well as 100 glory.
*   Adric's wife gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl. were ill but survived.
*   Arthen and husband adopted a newborn boy as heir. The boy was ill but survived.
*   Boudica's daughter, Calliope, was a year old and survived despite illness.
*   Adric's sister went missing. Investigations of it came up short.
*   There was a scandal involving Mag's brother supposedly having an illicit love affair.


### **Year 483 Adventure - The Marriage of Roderick**

The Year 483 saw the Easter Court is held at the Castle of the Slippery Ford, Lonazep. Earl Roderick had decided to press his claim for marrying Lady Elaine, as the King announced he would decide who would marry her. 

Our heroic knights were chosen to escort Earl Roderick and the train of gifts he had brought for King Uther. It was a dangerous journey, with the knights barely surviving a savage ambush (earning 25 glory in the process). Sir Mag was badly injured and needed to recover

The King was quite pleased with the gifts and chose to give Elaine’s hand to Roderick. The knights did find themselves defusing a romantic tryst Uther’s heir, Madoc, was having with the Lady Rhianneth, husband of  Sir Martinus. While Martinus wanted a duel, they managed to de-escalate matters (10 more glory).

The wedding of Roderick and Elaine that summer was quite the affair.  Boudica and and Arthen were seated at the salt of the feast while Adric was a little bit below - though he had quite the good time there. Boudica did engage in her own tryst with a lady. (25 glory)

**Year 483-484 Winter**



*   Boudica’s daughter, aged 2, survived illness.
*   Adric’s wife gave birth to a boy. Children -
	*   Twins, boy and girl, born 482-483

*   Arthen and husband adopted twin daughters. Children - 
	*   Boy, born 482-483
	*   Twin daughters, born 482-483


## Year 484 - Chapter V - Of the Saxon Invasion

King Uther did hold his Easter court in the White Tower of Thamesmouth. And there did the cries of the people reach the court, telling tales of a Saxon invasion. So spoke Uther, “Our Royal Brother, the King of Malahaut, has requested Our help against the Saxons. The full might of Logres will muster at Linden Pool.” While the great king did want to protect his people, so too was his blood boiled and looking forward to battle, ignoring the council of Dyke Corneus that they should allow the Saxon horde to exhaust itself first fighting Malahaut.” The druid Merlin was still nowhere to be found.

The battle went poorly for Uther and his host. Sir Adric led a coterie of knights - Boudica, Arthen, and Mag - as well levies within this host. Both Mag and Adric fell in the battle, Adric to a giant fighting with the Saxons. Left for dead, they were healed by Merlin, returned at last to give the king his council. As the defeated army regrouped, he advised a night attack on the celebrating Saxons. In this battle, Boudica took a role in leading the coterie, this time to victory. In the aftermath, Uther let word that he was prepared to knight all those eligible as soon as possible, for his ranks of knights had been greatly diminished..

## Year 485 - Chapter VI - Of the Battle of Mearcred Creek and Sir Leonard’s False Accusation

At Court in Leicester, King Uther declared his vassals to prepare for battle against the Saxon horde. Earl Roderick instructed his knights to make ready for the summer battles and assemble at the city of Salisbury.

Before they could depart to make their preparations, Sir Leonard, the bastard half-brother of Lady Boudica, came forth with an accusation against Sir Wulfric, husband of SIr Arthen. Their steward had recently gone missing. Sir Leonard claimed to have captured him trying to bring news of Uther’s plans to the Saxons on Wulfric’s orders. Sir Arthen protested, as Wulfric’s family had always shown loyalty to Uther and Aurelius before him. Lady Boudica was filled with rage, for she had often felt her half-brother’s ambitions for land and the treachery he was prepared to use to get that land. Despite their sharing a father, she pledged willingness to battle Sir Leonard to prove the truth of Sirs Arthen and Wulfric. However, Lord Brastias investigated the manner and found no merit to Sir Leonard’s claims. Sir Leonard left angry, swearing an oath he would not forget his sister’s treachery.

That summer the knights did assemble at Salisbury, ready to march against the Saxons. Merlin was nowhere to be seen, still exhausted from the magics he had performed the previous year. They marched against the Saxon King Aelle, though the forces of Duke Gorlois of Cornwall were nowhere to be seen.

The battle went poorly for Uther’s troops, though Earl Roderick’s knights fought well. Sir Elad, who had taught the knights Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag, led Earl Roderick’s forces. Alas, Elad fell in battle. Adric tried to do battle with King Aelle, even landing some blows, but the vile Saxon lord did escape as the two armies separated, neither being able to claim a true victory.

## Year 486 - Chapter VII - Of the Finding of Excalibur

At court in Windsor, Prince Madoc announced his intent to take a force to harry the Saxons around Colchester. Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag were all anxious to participate in the raiding but, to their dismay, Earl Roderick assigned them to sentry duty.

Sentry duty was boring. Their greatest challenge was a priest who spread ill words about their Prince Madoc. Adric proved unusually merciful towards him, letting him go with a stern warning.

During one of their patrols they met an old man dressed in tatters. He begged help from the brave knights, for his large, black goat had run up a hill where he could not follow. Showing kindness to the man, they led their horses up the hill to some ancient ruins where they found the goat - it was indeed a large goat - larger than any goat they had ever seen. “Hark,” said Mag. “Methinks this is not a normal goat!”

The goat tried to run off but was grabbed by a mighty three-eyed giant. Seeing the knights pursuing, the giant releases the goat and swung a mighty tree at Adric, crushing his skull and leaving him for dead. His squire picked up his master’s sword and fought bravely, as did the other knights. They finally triumphed when Mag cut the straps holding the giant’s armor in place, allowing them to strike it freely, felling him,

The old man appeared before them, wiping away his disguise and revealing himself as Merlin, the mighty wizard and protector of Britain. Using his mighty magics, he restored Adric to health. Merlin indicated he was pleased with their valor and might and he needed their assistance on an urgent mission for their king.

Merlin led them into the woods, telling them to leave their horses. He reached a lake and took a barge into the lake, instructing the knights they had to protect him. No sooner had he said that did a green warrior on a green horse come upon them, wielding two swords. The warrior was fearsome - but it did not seem human - nor did the horse seem to be a horse. Rather they seemed to be one being, made up of a greenish slime. It fought well, grievously injuring Mag, Boudica, and Adric. Merlin, reaching the center of the lake, called out to them, telling them they must persevere if they loved their lord. Inspired, Boudica managed to land a killing blow. 

On the lake, Merlin was communing with a being beneath the surface. An arm clutching a beautiful sword emerged, passing the sword to Merlin.

Merlin congratulated the knights on their valor, telling them Britain was in their debt. Earl Roderick was confused by his knights’ tale but impressed that they had rendered the mighty Merlin a service.

## Year 487 - Chapter VIII - The Great Sword Feast

Before the start of 487, Uther gathered his court in Sarum. There was much feasting and sharing of gifts for the holy day of Christmas. As the gift-giving reached it end, Merlin, Guardian of Britain approached.

“Gold and silver, clothing from far distant lands; these are surely gifts worthy of a king. Yet you, Uther, deserve more, for surely no one in the world has ever sat as high as you, not even the emperors of Rome.” Uther was clearly flattered. “Yet, even you lack one thing.” The king

frowned, the room murmured. “Such a great man deserves nothing but the best, and he who would bring peace to the whole of our great land deserves all that would help him

to obtain it. And so I, your humble servant, am pleased to offer you, from my weak hands, this.” 

And he pulled from beneath his robes a gleaming sword whose own internal light caused everyone to gasp in delight and wonder.

Even the king was surprised and stood  up. Merlin took the sword by its point, his hands covered by his robe so as not to tarnish the blade, and extended the pommel to the king. “For the High King,” said Merlin, and with a loud triumphant statement, “Excalibur, the

Sword of Victory!”

Everyone in the room gasped aloud, and when the king took the sword they broke into applause and cheer. It was clear that the king was highly pleased. “Surely, now,” he said, “no one can stand before me.”

“All you need do,” said  Merlin, “is to remain just.”

Our heroic knights became quite renowned as tales of their valor in acquiring Excalibur quickly spread. They were asked to recount their adventure which Sir Adric did to much praise.

The following spring the knights, now held in greater esteem, were given a choice by Earl Robert. They could accompany him and Uther to negotiate with Duke of Lindsey to secure his vote for High King, or accompany Prince Madoc on naval raids. They traveled to the Duke of Lindsey.

At Lincoln the party was greeted by the Duke of Lindsey - greeted rather stiffly, but properly. However, tales of the sword roused his fervor for Uther and he finally committed himself after a song by Sir Mag.

With this success Uther asked the knights to travel on to Malahaut, home of the Centurion King to parlay with him. This did not go as well - the Centurion King was away from Eburacum,

fighting Saxons. His steward treated them coldly. They went off in pursuit of him, joining the battle. Though they helped him triumph over the Saxon host, all he would commit to was that he would visit Uther when he had leisure time. Nevertheless, having secured at least one more vote for High King, Uther’s spirits were much improved.


### Middle English

Bifore the start of 487, Uther gathered his court yn sarum. Ther was muche feastyng and sharyng of gifts for the holy day of christmas. As the gift-givyng reached it ende, Merlyn, guardian of Britayn approached.

 

“Gold and silver, clothyng from far distant lands; these are surely gifts worthy of a kyng. Yet ye, Uther, deserve more, for surely none the world hath ever sat as high as ye, not evene the emperors of rome.” Uther was clearly flattered. “Yet, evene ye lack one thyng.” the kyng

frowned, the room murmured. “Such a great man deserves nothyng but the byst, and he who wolde bryng peace to the whole of oure great land deserves al that wolde help him

to obtayn it. And so I, youre humble servant, am pleased to offer ye, from my weak hands, this.” 

And he pulled from byneath his robes a gleamyng sword whose own ynternal light caused everyone to gasp yn delight and wonder.

 

Eene the kyng was surprised and stood  up. Merlyn took the sword by yts poynt, his hands covered by his robe so as not to tarnish the blade, and extended the pommel to the kyng. “For the high kyng,” said Merlyn, and with a loud triumphant statement, “Excalibur, the

sword of victory!”

Everyone yn the room gasped aloud, and whan the kyng took the sword they broke ynto applause and cheer. It was clear that the kyng was highly pleased. “surely, now,” he said, “no oon can stand bifore me.”

“All ye need doon,” said  Merlyn, “is to remayn juste.”

Oure heroic knights bycame quite renowned as tales of their valor yn acquiryng excalibur quickly spread. They were asked to recount their adventure whiche Sir Adric did to muche praise.

 

The followyng spryng the knights, nowe held yn greater esteem, were given a choice by earl robert. They could accompanie him and Uther to negotiate with Duke of Lyndsey to secure his vote for high kyng, or accompanie Prynce Madoc on naval raids. They traveled to the duke of Lyndsey.

 

At Lyncoln the party was greeted by the Duke of Lyndsey - greeted rather stiffly, but properly. However, tales of the sword roused his fervor for Uther and he fynally committed himself after a song by Sir Mag.

 

With this success Uther asked the knights to travel on to Malahaut, home of the Centurion Kyng to parlay with him. This did not goon as wel - the Centurion Kyng was away from Eburacum,

fightyng Saxons. His steward treated them coldly. They wende off yn pursuit of him, joynyng the battle. Though they helped him triumph over the Saxon host, al he wolde commit to was that he wolde visit Uther whan he had leisure tyme. Nevertheless, havyng secured at least oon more vote for high kyng, Uther’s spirits were muche ymproved.

## Year 488 - Chapter IX - The Invasion of Frankland

While King Uther kept the peace at home, Adric, Arthen,Boudica, and Mag traveled with Prince Madoc as part of an army invading Frankland, assisting Praetor Syagrius - though Madoc’s commitment was uncertain, as they heard him declaring to his lieutenants “four weeks or one city, no more”. 

The four of them spent some time escorting the Praetor as he rode through his old lands, rallying troops to through out the evil Franks,. They did battle with Franks seeking to kill the rightful ruler of the land.

That one city turned out to be a siege of Bayeaux. They held their distance until troops began opening the gates, then Boudica, perhaps a little foolishly, rode full on to stop the defenders from closing the gates again. She endured a storm of arrows and was assisted by Adric, Arthen, and Mag against a giant of a man trying to seal the gates. 

The city was sacked and looted, giving the knights great wealth. However, Prince Madoc refused to continue assisting the Praetor, claiming there were enemies at home that needed tending to. At the next tide the forces of Madoc departed, leaving Syagrius to his own devices.

Earl Roderick sympathized when Adric questioned these actions, but said it was not their place to question their leaders, no matter how iniquitous they may seem…

## Year 489 - Chapter X - Excalibur’s Peace

Tired of Duke Gorlois of Cornwal’s wavering allegiance, Uther rode with Merlin and many of his knights to confront the disloyal duke. The duke had many men - though he might be defeated, the battle was certain to be deadly.

Uther rode forward to parley, Merlin beside him. The king yelled, “One land, one king!” “Justice!” shouted Gorlois back. “Show him the sword.” Uther drew Excalibur and it gleamed brightly even in the morning light. The bright light revealed troops in the woods and they gasped and withdrew. Duke Gorlois looked worriedly at his nobles around him. They were worried. “Behold the Sword of Victory,” said Merlin, “forged when the world was young.” 

The duke held a hurried parley with his men, then stepped back toward Uther and shouted. “And if I surrender, what do I get?” 

“You get…!?” started the king, but he was interrupted by Merlin, who held a hurried chat with Uther. 

Then the king continued, “All the land from here to the sea, to hold for the king.” “I accept!” shouted the duke. A big cheer went up from both armies. Gorlois and Uther camped together, spending the knight drinking and talking, and late at night the duke goes away. 

However, the Saxons took advantage of Uther’s need to tend to his rogue duke, with Oeric, brother of King Octa, taking a castle at Roestoc. After a brutal battle, the knights Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag led their forces to victory and took Oeric as their prisoner, earning great glorty and esteem from their king.

## Year 490 - Chapter XI - The Battle of Lindsey

At long last the time had come to deal with King Octa of the Saxons. He had driven Malahaut to the ground and pillaged the countryside. Earl Roderick’s knights assembled at the center of the line behind King Uther’s leadership. Duke Ulfius took the right flank and Duke Gorlois the left.

The battle lasted for many hours, with Duke Gorlois bringing low the giant warrior Eosa. The center of the Saxon army collapsed, leaving King Octa vulnerable, protected by just three of his heorthengeats, all of them mounted. The knights Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag charged into battle. After a brutal battle they slew his guardians and brought low the king, taking him a prisoner for King Uther.

With the capture of King Octa, Roderick’s knights were held in great esteem and invited to a place of prominence in the victory feast. There they noticed King Uther had eyes just for Ygraine, wife of Duke Gorlois. Both Boudica and, to a lesser extent, Mag, were captivated by her charms. As winter came on most of Uther’s loyal lords were dismissed but not Gorlois. As it became apparent the king was not going to dismiss them, they fled in the knight. Adric tried to sound an alarm but aided by the magic of Nineve, one of the Ladies of the Lake, they were able to escape. The king was enraged and swore he would have his revenge on his disloyal lord.

## Year 491 - Chapter XII - The Battle of Tintagel

“I have been insulted deeply, and for no good reason. The Duke of Cornwall has broken his word and violated our hospitality. His sudden flight from our court proves he is guilty; no other information need be sought. Worse, though, his people slew some servants in their escape, and they stole treasure when they fled. Gorlois is guilty.

“Disloyalty and dishonor are not welcome in this kingdom. It is the obligation of every noble to serve with distinction and to uphold noblesse oblige. Anyone who disobeys these laws is a traitor.

“Gorlois is a traitor.”

With that, Uther mobilized most of the forces in his kingdom to march upon Tintagel - even as Saxons began raiding again. Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag were part of Prince Madoc’s forces attacking Terrabil to prevent a counterattack while Uther’s forces attacked Tintagel.

Gorlois joined his men at Terrabil and in a terrible battle, slew Prince Madoc. The four knights had attempted to protect their king’s heir but were only able to avenge him, slaying Duke Gorlois.

In the confusion that followed there were reports that Gorlois had returned to Tintagel, something that was impossible for it occurred after his death and his body was not lost - nor was it given a proper Christian funeral, for as a traitor he had damned himself - so spake Uther. There was a funeral for Prince Madoc at Stonehenge and there was great mourning, for the kingdom was without an heir. 

Shortly after the funeral, King Uther married Gorlois’ widow, Ygraine. Though an awkward event, it was viewed as advantageous for the widow, gaining protection, and hopefully would provide the kingdom with a new heir. 

 \\
The four knights spent at frugal Christmas garrisoning Terrabil, also spending some time at. Tintagel. There they met the three daughters of Ygraine.



*   Margawse, the eldest. A pretty and conniving woman, a bit rebellious, in her late teens. Of marriageable age, she is the object of numerous rumors regarding whom the king will marry her to.
*   Elaine, the middle child. A young woman, less pretty than Margawse and less clever than her younger. She is also of marriageable age, and rumors of dowry and betrothal also surround her.
*   Morgan, the youngest. A dark and brooding girl who watches everything and says nothing in the pres- ence of her betters. Too young to marry, she nonetheless is eyed as a candidate soon for those who would want to get close to the king.

Gifts this Christmas came from Sir Thebert, the temporary lord of the castle, sufficient to maintain their statuses. As a result of raids in France and the Battle of Lindsey the four had become moderately wealthy.

## Year 492 - Chapter XIII - The Lost Heir

In the Year of our Lord 492, King Uther held his court at Tintagel, with his new bride, Ygraine. The queen was expecting a child in the summer and all the men of good will in the kingdom prayed for a male heir. After the Easter feast a pair of weddings were held for the king’s eldest two stepdaughters - King Lot was wed to Margawse and King Nentres to Elaine. The youngest, Morgan, was still too young to be betrothed.

That summer the queen gave birth to a healthy boy, giving the king a new heir. The four knights who had assisted Merlin retrieve Excalibur patrolled the region near Tintagel. One day they encountered Merlin who instructed them that he needed their aid again. They followed him for many hours and then departed, telling them to stand ready on their horses and that he would return. When he returned some hours later he was carrying a bundle and told the four knights to delay his pursuers. Mag wondered if it could be a baby the wizard was carrying.

Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag stood to delay the approaching knights who were in pursuit. To their horror they discovered it was one of the king’s top advisors, Brastias, leading the pursuit. The pursuers shouted for Merlin and declared him a traitor - and cursed the knights for delaying the pursuit. Despite this, Boudica blocked their paths, believing that Merlin would not act without just cause. She was eventually wrestled to the ground and bound by Brastias’ men. The pursuit continued, with other knights who had been sent by Merlin to delay encountered as well, but there was no sign of the wizard or the lost heir.

As confusion reigned in the next days, the four knights reported to Salisbury and told Earl Roderick what had transpire. When they were summoned back to Tintagel to answer for what had happened, Roderick sent his Marshall, Sir Elad, son of Elad, and Bishop Roger, to assist in their legal challenges. Sir Brastias indicated they would have to answer the charge of treason, a grievous charge that could carry the penalty of death and seizure of lands. They met with Elad and Roger, telling them truthfully what happened - as well as with Father Dewi, who was quite suspicious of the pagans among them.

At the trial it was clear that the queen desired their deaths. In the end, the king’s religious advisor, Illtyd, encouraged by Elad and Roger, suggested that Merlin had enchanted the good knights, who had never shown such treasonous behavior before. Uther encouraged them to agree to theory., Arthen and Adric declared their loyalty to Uther loudly, though Adric did declare that Merlin had never led them astray before. Mag declared he had done all that they had been accused of and for them to do as they will. Boudica, while careful not to denounce King Uther, indicated she believed all Merlin did was for the good of the kingdom.

In the end Uther rendered his judgement. “Then let Justice reign. Here is the word of the King of Logres. 

“These men are innocent of treason. They, and all with like charges, are dismissed and ordered to see Bishop Dubricus for blessing and purification from pagan taint. 

“Furthermore, this court determines that Merlin the Enchanter was behind this, and he is hereby con-demned to death by this court as an exile and traitor to the crown, who has willingly and knowingly harmed the throne. Let this news be sent forth to all the lords and guilds for reading in public places. 

“God bless us all. This court is adjourned.”

The four knights, though they did no such thing, became known as the knights who condemned Merlin. Though their honor had been wounded, their liege Roderick had defended them and protected them from the wrath of the king.

## Year 494 - Chapter XIV - Ambush Near Malahaut

Though Saxons were encroaching on his kingdom, King Uther was rarely seen, nor was his new queen, Ygraine. The Saxon kings, Octa and Eosa had escaped. Octa had sworn revenge against Mag for taking his enchanted ax. 

In this chaos, Earl Roderick was sent to the King of Malahaut to secure an alliance against the Saxons. With him traveled a small party - his squire, his knights, Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag, and their squires. He commented to his loyal knights how some day his heir, Robert, would one day need a knight to squire to and he hoped it would be one of them or one like them.

Their time at Malahaut went poorly. Northern envoys were also present, including several from the Saxons. Roderick’s knights learned much intrigue - that the northern Kings and Saxons were making plans to attack Uther while he was weak.

Without a formal alliance, the earl and his retinue departed. On their journey home they were ambushed by a Saxon raiding party at a stream. They were led by one of Octa’s most loyal men, Oswulf. Also with them was the berserker Cedric, the werwulf Coenwulf, and two warriors. The knights moved to protect their liege, but Roderick joined them in the melee. Boudica struck Coenwulf hard, but to no avail, for he could only be wounded by enchanted weapons. That had to wait until Mag finished his battle with Oswulf. Meanwhile, Cedric and Adric did battle as did Arthen and two Saxon warriors. The knights, aided by their liege, proved victorious in battle and they completed their journey home.

That Christmas made for a sad court, with Uther apparently ill and the Saxon kings, Octa and Eosa marching south.

## Year 494 - Chapter XIV - Embassy to Estergales

All was not well in Logres. The king was ill. Some claimed he called for Merlin to help him, though Queen Ygraine still desired his head. The Saxons kings Eosa and Octa continued their attacks on the lands of good King Uther.

Earl Roderick’s loyal knights, Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag were dispatched to Estergales to treat with King Canan, as King Uther needed more allies against the Saxons. They rode off for a long journey. They passed through Gloucester, escorted by the twin sons of its duke, the bannerets of Glevum. They traveled on to the ancient Roman city of Carlion, where they were met by Sir Alain de Carilon, who had commanded the knights when they garrisoned Terrabil and Tintagel. He took them to the King of Escavalon, Nanteleod. They continued west to Cardiff and then, finally to Estergales, meeting with King Canan at his court in Pembroke.

After delivering their letter from King Uther, King Canan needed time to consider. He needed much time. In that time the knights had much time to themselves. They raced with a chieftain of the hill savages, learning him to be actually King Ystrad Tyi - the savage king was impressed that both Arthen and Adric were able to outrace him on horseback and sent word to King Canan, his ally, of their prowess. 

They had to follow King Canan as he moved his court throughout his kingdom. At Castle Tenby he announced he would indeed help King Uther but he needed time to prepare his official reply.

 \\
Court moved to Carmarthen, birthplace of Merlin. There, at a feast, King Canan took a goblet from his son, Sir Dirac, and drained it - and quickly died of the poison within. However, Adric spied the goblet had been passed to Sir Dirac by Sir Orcas, the king’s steward. When Mag called this to the court’s attention Orcas was greatly angered and challenged Mag to a duel. In that duel, God proved the righteousness of Mag’s claim, Mag striking down Orcas with ease. Orcas survived and was imprisoned by the new King Dirac. 

Though Dirac pledged to support Uther, there was little help he could give, as his own kingdom was falling into rebellion. As the knights returned to their manors, they learned Octa and Eosa had launched attacks on Lincoln.

## Year 495 - Chapter XV - The Battle of Saint Albans and the Infamous Feast

Times were not well in the Kingdom of Logres. King Uther was ill, rumored to be at death’s door. However, he let it be known he and his knights would retake the city of Saint Albans from the Saxons. He led his army from a litter, some 1,500 knights and 5,000 on foot against King Octa’s horde of 9,000.

Over a thousand of Uther’s footsoldiers fell in battle when they were trapped in the seemingly unguarded city. Adric, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag fought their way out of the city.

The next morning was a great battle, as Octa led his host against Uther’s. A pair of berserkers and a werwulf charged at the four knights. In the battle, Sir Adric fell, nobly fighting against one of the berserkers. His squire, Trenton, took up his master’s sword. In the battle Boudica led one of the berserkers on a long chase so that Arthen and Mag, who had dispatched the werwulf, could attack it in unison. After they did so, Boudica, with a wounded horse, Arthen, and Mag did battle with the remaining berserker whilst Tristan did battle with Saxon warriors.

As the battle continued the three remaining knights found King Octa, guarded by some of his mightiest soldiers - though like the three, Octa and his men were bloodied. They did engage in great battle, with Octa desiring to gain his enchanted ax back from Mag. In the end, the three were triumphant, slaying his men and stunning him to near death Before they could secure their prisoner, Sir Tristan, a bastard half-brother of Boudica charged in and retrieved the injured king, stealing credit for their victory. 

That evening there was a great celebration in the castle of Saint Albans. The nobles and those who most distinguished themselves were invited to the Great Hall while the bulk of the knights and army celebrated in the bailey. Earl Roderick argued for his three remaining great knights to attend, having witnessed what truly had transpired but it was Sir Tristan who was invited in their stead. Duke Ulfius and Sir Brastias both received grave wounds and were in the hospital.

There was much mourning and celebrating the lives of the many fallen knights. Great toasts were made in memory of Sir Adric. However, as midnight approached they heard screaming from the Great Hall Running in, Arthen, Boudica, and Mag saw Sir Tristan, his face blue and vomiting blood. The same fate was befalling all those in the Great Hall, including King Uther and Earl Roderick. In one night, the king and most of his nobles had been slain by treachery most foul!

After attending the funerals of King Uther and Earl Roderick the remaining knights met with Roderick’s widow, Countess Ellen. With Roderick’s son, Robert, just three years of age, would they follow her and give her the same council they provided to her late husband until Robert came of age?. They quickly pledged their loyalty, Boudica first among them. Alas, the land had no king, with Prince Modoc having perished and the second heir having been stolen by Merlin.

That winter Trenton was knighted by the recovering Duke Ulfius, one of the few survivors of the high nobility. Adric’s eldest son, Heckle, now 13, would squire for him. It was a difficult winter with Adric’s wife dying in childbirth and great pestilence ravaging the land - Boudica losing her daughter Rose, and Mag losing two children, his bastard son Cormac and daughter Finnola. Many other children were ill that winter.
