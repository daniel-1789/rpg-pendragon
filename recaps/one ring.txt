### The Journey
The Fellowship is enlisted by Gandalf the Grey to investigate strange blue lights at the foothills of the Ered Luin Mountains, visible from as far as Sarn Ford. Travelers in the vicinity had been disappearing.

They journeyed west from Bree into the Shire. There they encountered Master Bilbo Baggins who feasted them at the Inn of the Green Dragon. He taught them a song to give them fortitude in battle, taught to him by the Dwarfs on the Lonely Mountain. They then traveled south to the foothills of the Ered Luin, finding signs of brigands along their way.

### The Adventure
The tower from which the blue light could be seen was the only relatively intact building in an old Arthedain fortress town, now centuries ruined. A chasm separated them from the ruins. The Fellowship found steps leading into a cave on their side of the chasm and dealt with four brigands standing sentry there, with signs of many more brigands away.

### Mechanical Notes
- Bilbo's song - can be used once, removes the effects of exhaustion during battle, secondary action to activate.
