## Year 510 - Chapter XXIX- The Boy King
Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul accompanied young Earl Robert to the tournament at London. The tournament was a new thing - battle not to the death. It was a chaotic affair, something that the faerie folk would enjoy.

However, all was upended was a beardless bastard, Arthur, drew the sword Excalibur, from the sword it had been embedded in since the death of Uther. There were many witnesses, among them Merlin, back from his voyages. A small number of those swore immediate loyalty to Arthur, among them being King Leodegrance of Cameliard; Sir Ector, Arthur’s stepfather; Sir Kay, Arthur’s 
step-brother; Sir Hervis de Revil, a famous but landless knight; Prince Lanceor of Estregales, son of the King of Estregales; the famous Sir Brastias; Lady Calliope; Sir Heckle; Sir Leofric; and Sir Maul. Earl Robert was hesitant to swear loyalty, drawing the sword or no, and King Lot was adamant that a beardless bastard would never rule.

Merlin chose ten knights to guard the sword which was returned to the stone so that it could be drawn again for more witnesses - and again, none were able to draw it forth. Among the knights chosen for the honor of guarding the sword included Earl Robert’s knights.

On Candlemas, February 2, Arthur drew the sword again. More pledged their loyalty to him as king, to be known as the “Eager Vassals”. The Eager Vassals included young Earl Robert of Salisbury; Ulfius, Duke of Silchester; Duke Corneus of Lindsey; Bishop Baudwin of Britain; the Earl of Hertford; the Earl of Dorset; and many lesser lords and knights.

On Easter, Arthur drew the sword for a third time. This time, more of the rest of the Logres noblemen pledged their loyalty. They are called the “Good Vassals,” and include the Duke of Clarence; the Earl of Jagent; the Earl of Wuerensis; and many others.

In May, on Pentecost, Arthur drew the sword for a fourth time. He was knighted by Sir Brastias, an act Merlin found amusing. At St. Paul’s Cathedral he was coronated as King of Logres and there were great rejoicing, for the land had a king again.

The king and his retinue traveled to Carlion-on-Usk. There, on May 10 the Collegium assembled - or at least a majority of it did - and named Arthur the High King, the Pendragon. 

However, King Lot was not idle and had brought an army to contest Arthur. They besieged Carlion. Against the advice of his knights Arthur initially stayed behind the walls. Robert’s knights rode forth to assemble allies and did battle with King Lot. Though Arthur was inexperienced, with the aid of Merlin and his knights, was able to win an indecisive victory.  

That summer Arthur and his many knights stayed at Bedegraine Castle. Rumor had it he and the earl’s daughter, Lyzianor, had become fond of each other. As the summer waned, the knights heard reports that King Ryons of Norgales was raiding King Leodegrance of Cameliard. Given Leodegrance’s early allegiance, the knights of Salisbury helped drive off Ryon’s forces, capturing the mighty Sir Harte of the great antlered helm. 
  
There was much celebrating in the realm, for though the kingdom was not yet secure, for the first time in a generation there was a king…

## Year 511 - Chapter XXX - Retaking Cair Maug

The year 511 saw some much needed consolidation. Queen Margawse of Lothian was at the court at Carlion - rumor had it when she left she was with child.

Heckle had to defend his sister from accusations of being a horse thief, She pled that she was following the orders of another king the centaur king Agametrius, It seemed she might have lost her mind until the centaur king arrived in Carlion.

He explained that several sacred horses, blessed with speech, had been lost to humans. The knights agreed to help him and Heckle’s sister by leafing a raid on Cair Maug, the tower where Maug, uncle of Maul, had fallen in battle. The Saxons had recently retaken it, under Thane Alfred - mounted on a talking horse.

The knights were able to launch a surprise attack, bursting into the barracks on horseback. The battle within was furious, with a great fire breaking out and forcing them out. They slew Alfred and retook Cair Maug, though his nephew was badly wounded in the battle. Unlike his uncle, he survived the surgeon’s knife.

## Year 512 - Chapter XXXI - The Tragedy of Sir Balin

Earl Robert’s Knights traveled with King Arthur, starting the season at Silchester and traveling to St. Albans where Uther had been killed. It was there that he learned the truth of his birth, that he was Uther’s heir by Ygraine and reunited with his mother. In addition to his claim of kingship through Excalibur he was the legitimate heir.

In the early spring, against the counsel of his knights Arthur dueled with King Pellinore and was honorably defeated and disarmed, Excalibur being shattered. It was through the Ladies of the Lake that Excalibur was repaired.

Later that spring there was much intrigue at the court. First, a maiden with a sword appeared at court, asking if a true knight could help her draw it. None could until the somewhat disgraced Sir Balin, late of Arthur’s dungeons for a minor crime, did so. However he refused to return the sword to her despite the maiden claiming he would regret his folly:
> Well ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay with that sword the best friend that you have, and the man that ye most love in the world, and the sword shall be your destruction.

Balin departed with his two swords, with one of the Ladies of the Lake arriving next. She demanded payment for restoring Excalibur - the head of the maiden lately departed or Sir Balin’s head. The king refused, saying he could not do so without loss of honor. Sir Balin, armed with two swords, returned and struck off her head, to the fury of Arthur. Balin claimed that Lady of the Lake was a wicked one, untrue and using her magic for evil. Arthur cared not for the violation of hospitality, and declared him an outlaw. 

Balin left court, pursued by many knights. He slew Lanceor. Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul continued the pursuit. They chased him throughout the summer.
> Sir Balin continues on his way across Britain, seeking to stay the malicious Invisible Knight. He enters the Perilous Forest and finds his way to Listeneisse, to King Pellam’s castle. There, all rules of hospitality are broken.

> Sir Balin is struck by the Invisible Knight and lashes out, slaying the dastard. Then he finds out that his host, King Pellam, is actually the brother to the Invisible Knight. The king pursues Balin through the castle to kill him. Balin at last grabs a spear off a wall and strikes the king down. The entire castle shakes, rumbles, and falls to the earth, destroyed. 
> 
> The entire kingdom is laid waste, and is afterward called the Wasteland. Once entered, the Wasteland’s  borders are limitless, for Faerie quickly overwhelms the natural world there. As well, the invisible Wasteland, the one that inhabits men’s souls, is loosed into the realm. 

The four knights pursuing him saw the destruction of the castle and the wasting of the kingdom. From a dying squire they learned what had transpired and continued their pursuit of Balin.

> Sir Balin wanders from the ruins of the Grail Castle, only to meet his end when he is given new arms and told to fight the Red Knight at the nearby ford. (To do so was the local custom among knights, he is told.) Thus, Sir Balin goes and fights his own brother Sir Balan to death — for that is the identity of the Red Knight — neither recognizing the other. Both knights die here and are buried in a great tomb by Merlin. 

The four knights reached Sir Balin as his brother Balan died. Balin, though grievously wounded and near death, still lived. Enraged, he charged at his pursuers. Joining him were a pair of fey knights, brought into the realm by the dolorous stroke which had lain waste to Grail Castle. Balin and one of the fey knights fell to the pursuers, the other fey returning to his realm.

Other events happened in Britain that year. In mid-May Merlin and Lady Nineve visited the kings of the north, spreading tales that a famous boy had just been born. Departing, they took many boys with them to sea. This included Queen Margawse’s son, whom some whispered was not the heir of King Lot bur rather the result of relations with the young Arthur. In a scrying pool she witnessed the ship splitting open and sinking during a storm.

Also that summer Arthur’s forces defeated those of the Centurion King, loyal to Lot. The Centurion King died in that battle and was replaced by his son who surrendered to Arthur.
