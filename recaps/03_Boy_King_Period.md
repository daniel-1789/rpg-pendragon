# The Great Pendragon Campaign Recap - Boy King Period


![Pendragon Players' Map][image-1]

## Year 510 - Chapter XXIX- The Boy King
Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul accompanied young Earl Robert to the tournament at London. The tournament was a new thing - battle not to the death. It was a chaotic affair, something that the faerie folk would enjoy.

However, all was upended was a beardless bastard, Arthur, drew the sword Excalibur, from the sword it had been embedded in since the death of Uther. There were many witnesses, among them Merlin, back from his voyages. A small number of those swore immediate loyalty to Arthur, among them being King Leodegrance of Cameliard; Sir Ector, Arthur’s stepfather; Sir Kay, Arthur’s 
step-brother; Sir Hervis de Revil, a famous but landless knight; Prince Lanceor of Estregales, son of the King of Estregales; the famous Sir Brastias; Lady Calliope; Sir Heckle; Sir Leofric; and Sir Maul. Earl Robert was hesitant to swear loyalty, drawing the sword or no, and King Lot was adamant that a beardless bastard would never rule.

Merlin chose ten knights to guard the sword which was returned to the stone so that it could be drawn again for more witnesses - and again, none were able to draw it forth. Among the knights chosen for the honor of guarding the sword included Earl Robert’s knights.

On Candlemas, February 2, Arthur drew the sword again. More pledged their loyalty to him as king, to be known as the “Eager Vassals”. The Eager Vassals included young Earl Robert of Salisbury; Ulfius, Duke of Silchester; Duke Corneus of Lindsey; Bishop Baudwin of Britain; the Earl of Hertford; the Earl of Dorset; and many lesser lords and knights.

On Easter, Arthur drew the sword for a third time. This time, more of the rest of the Logres noblemen pledged their loyalty. They are called the “Good Vassals,” and include the Duke of Clarence; the Earl of Jagent; the Earl of Wuerensis; and many others.

In May, on Pentecost, Arthur drew the sword for a fourth time. He was knighted by Sir Brastias, an act Merlin found amusing. At St. Paul’s Cathedral he was coronated as King of Logres and there were great rejoicing, for the land had a king again.

The king and his retinue traveled to Carlion-on-Usk. There, on May 10 the Collegium assembled - or at least a majority of it did - and named Arthur the High King, the Pendragon. 

However, King Lot was not idle and had brought an army to contest Arthur. They besieged Carlion. Against the advice of his knights Arthur initially stayed behind the walls. Robert’s knights rode forth to assemble allies and did battle with King Lot. Though Arthur was inexperienced, with the aid of Merlin and his knights, was able to win an indecisive victory.  

That summer Arthur and his many knights stayed at Bedegraine Castle. Rumor had it he and the earl’s daughter, Lyzianor, had become fond of each other. As the summer waned, the knights heard reports that King Ryons of Norgales was raiding King Leodegrance of Cameliard. Given Leodegrance’s early allegiance, the knights of Salisbury helped drive off Ryon’s forces, capturing the mighty Sir Harte of the great antlered helm. 
  
There was much celebrating in the realm, for though the kingdom was not yet secure, for the first time in a generation there was a king…

## Year 511 - Chapter XXX - Retaking Cair Maug

The year 511 saw some much needed consolidation. Queen Margawse of Lothian was at the court at Carlion - rumor had it when she left she was with child.

Heckle had to defend his sister from accusations of being a horse thief, She pled that she was following the orders of another king the centaur king Agametrius, It seemed she might have lost her mind until the centaur king arrived in Carlion.

He explained that several sacred horses, blessed with speech, had been lost to humans. The knights agreed to help him and Heckle’s sister by leafing a raid on Cair Maug, the tower where Maug, uncle of Maul, had fallen in battle. The Saxons had recently retaken it, under Thane Alfred - mounted on a talking horse.

The knights were able to launch a surprise attack, bursting into the barracks on horseback. The battle within was furious, with a great fire breaking out and forcing them out. They slew Alfred and retook Cair Maug, though his nephew was badly wounded in the battle. Unlike his uncle, he survived the surgeon’s knife.

## Year 512 - Chapter XXXI - The Tragedy of Sir Balin

Earl Robert’s Knights traveled with King Arthur, starting the season at Silchester and traveling to St. Albans where Uther had been killed. It was there that he learned the truth of his birth, that he was Uther’s heir by Ygraine and reunited with his mother. In addition to his claim of kingship through Excalibur he was the legitimate heir.

In the early spring, against the counsel of his knights Arthur dueled with King Pellinore and was honorably defeated and disarmed, Excalibur being shattered. It was through the Ladies of the Lake that Excalibur was repaired.

Later that spring there was much intrigue at the court. First, a maiden with a sword appeared at court, asking if a true knight could help her draw it. None could until the somewhat disgraced Sir Balin, late of Arthur’s dungeons for a minor crime, did so. However he refused to return the sword to her despite the maiden claiming he would regret his folly:
> Well ye are not wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay with that sword the best friend that you have, and the man that ye most love in the world, and the sword shall be your destruction.

Balin departed with his two swords, with one of the Ladies of the Lake arriving next. She demanded payment for restoring Excalibur - the head of the maiden lately departed or Sir Balin’s head. The king refused, saying he could not do so without loss of honor. Sir Balin, armed with two swords, returned and struck off her head, to the fury of Arthur. Balin claimed that Lady of the Lake was a wicked one, untrue and using her magic for evil. Arthur cared not for the violation of hospitality, and declared him an outlaw. 

Balin left court, pursued by many knights. He slew Lanceor. Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul continued the pursuit. They chased him throughout the summer.
> Sir Balin continues on his way across Britain, seeking to stay the malicious Invisible Knight. He enters the Perilous Forest and finds his way to Listeneisse, to King Pellam’s castle. There, all rules of hospitality are broken.

> Sir Balin is struck by the Invisible Knight and lashes out, slaying the dastard. Then he finds out that his host, King Pellam, is actually the brother to the Invisible Knight. The king pursues Balin through the castle to kill him. Balin at last grabs a spear off a wall and strikes the king down. The entire castle shakes, rumbles, and falls to the earth, destroyed. 
> 
> The entire kingdom is laid waste, and is afterward called the Wasteland. Once entered, the Wasteland’s  borders are limitless, for Faerie quickly overwhelms the natural world there. As well, the invisible Wasteland, the one that inhabits men’s souls, is loosed into the realm. 

The four knights pursuing him saw the destruction of the castle and the wasting of the kingdom. From a dying squire they learned what had transpired and continued their pursuit of Balin.

> Sir Balin wanders from the ruins of the Grail Castle, only to meet his end when he is given new arms and told to fight the Red Knight at the nearby ford. (To do so was the local custom among knights, he is told.) Thus, Sir Balin goes and fights his own brother Sir Balan to death — for that is the identity of the Red Knight — neither recognizing the other. Both knights die here and are buried in a great tomb by Merlin. 

The four knights reached Sir Balin as his brother Balan died. Balin, though grievously wounded and near death, still lived. Enraged, he charged at his pursuers. Joining him were a pair of fey knights, brought into the realm by the dolorous stroke which had lain waste to Grail Castle. Balin and one of the fey knights fell to the pursuers, the other fey returning to his realm.

Other events happened in Britain that year. In mid-May Merlin and Lady Nineve visited the kings of the north, spreading tales that a famous boy had just been born. Departing, they took many boys with them to sea. This included Queen Margawse’s son, whom some whispered was not the heir of King Lot bur rather the result of relations with the young Arthur. In a scrying pool she witnessed the ship splitting open and sinking during a storm.

Also that summer Arthur’s forces defeated those of the Centurion King, loyal to Lot. The Centurion King died in that battle and was replaced by his son who surrendered to Arthur.

## Year 513 - Chapter XXXII - The Lost Children

Tales of children lost in the northern lands reached Arthur's ears. He dispatched Merlin to investigate the truth of such claims. However, rumor was he was behind those lost children, having put many northern children on a ship last year. Not fully trusting him, Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul accompanied him.

Talking with many people along the North Sea coast they came upon an elderly woman and her fisherman son who told of a tale how a year ago the woman's husband had been lost at sea trying to help a sunken ship.

The next morning the fisherman took the knights and Merlin out to sea - under the water, in an amazingly clear part of the sea, they saw both a sunken fishing boat and a sunken ship. With their squires' aid they hoisted the fishing boat up and discovered the elder still alive, sleeping an enchanted sleep due to an elf shot wound - taking the small arrow out of him he awoke, spitting up water and told the tale of the ship foundering and assaulted by tiny faerie folk. Though there were no more bodies to be found, it was not impossible the children were still alive. 

Their musings were ended by the appearance of a northman dragon ship which saw potentially easy prey. They battled the northmen in a savage fight, Merlin eventually using his magics to rile up the sea. However, he seemed to care not whether the knights were drowned by the seas as well, angered he was that his plans the previous year to spirit children out of the north - for his own reasons which he had claimed were for Aethur's and Britain's benefit - had come to naught. Eventually, Calliope, reminding him of the services her mother Boudica, Adric, Arthen, and Mag had done for him and he relented.

Whilst these adventures took place Arthur marched to the north with his armies and King Lot was defeated and slain.

## Year 514 - Chapter XXXIII - Marriage and Balin’s Land

The year of our Lord DXIV saw Arthur married to Guenever. Like many, Heckle and Maul found themselves haunted by the new queen’s beauty.

Arthur granted boons to his noble followers. Calliope asked for help in finding her missing brother, Remus. Leofric received a manor to add to his lands, a useful boon to his family given his husband did not have land of his own. Heckle, seeking a chance for glory, was granted the title of Sheriff of Essex, to enforce the king’s law once that Saxon land were brought back into Britain. Maul received goats and cattle to produce cheese, increasing his wealth.

At Arthur’s urging, Merlin took the four knights to help find Remus, who, it seemed, had fallen between worlds due to the stroke that Balin made in the Grail castle two years previous. In the realm of Faerie, Calliope led the way across a bladed bridge to a small island with the tombs of Sir Balin and his brother. They traveled further to a beautiful city of glass ruled by Princess Alia. As guests, they stayed the night, Maul and Heckle enjoying the company of the elven ladies Hermione and Floria. The next morning, as the princess had promised, they saw Remus - riding on behalf of King Fisherman of the Castle of Joy - the king was besieged by the forces of Castle Mortal and he was riding for help. The four knights made the journey, as strange a journey as they had made, testing their chivalry.

At the Castle of Joy they rode through the besieging armies and met with King Fisherman, greatly wounded. Calliope asked what ailed him and how they could help - unknowingly the first question required to heal him, though she didn’t have the religious conviction to help him further. Perhaps at a later time a knight - perhaps one of them - could use the Holy Grail to heal him. 

They did, however, agree to help King Fisherman - to get aid from his kin, to try to pull some of the forces of Castle Mortal away, to find allies in the coming battle. Riding out to perform these quests they returned to their own world and discovered many months had passed, though mere days had passed for them…

## Year 515 - Chapter XXXIV - The Battle of Castle Joy
![][image-4]

Though it would take the knights some time to realize it, an entire year had passed for the mundane world during their time in the faerie lands. They began their quest to find allies, most importantly Alain le Gros.

Their first visit was to Lord Eurain of Brandigan Castle. Learning that King Balor was among the Castle of Joy's enemies he agreed to help them and gave them advise to finding Alain.

At Castle Blanc, Bishop Baudwin was torn, for he saw the justice of the knights' cause but had been pledged to harry the Saxons. He eventually agreed to send some troops to help in the battle.

Near Leeds they encountered Sis Lamorak de Gales, son of King Pellinore. He challenged them to jousting, defeating Leofric and Heckle in honorable jousting for love. As they feasted afterwards Maul challenged him to a pie-eating contest, which he was also victorious in. Liking his new friends, he indicated Alain was a kinsman of his and he would gather his family to assist in the coming fight - and reinforced Bishop Baudwin's suggestions -
> If Baudwin sent you to Etroite, try there. I must go where I know my brothers are. But in the name of knighthood, I ask you to bring a message to the daughter of the lord of Etroite. My thanks to you, good Sirs. 

> Tell the daughter named Isabel that I, Sir Lamorak the son of Pellinore, have seen the Knight of the Silver Axe, and he is well. Give her this ring, which is a token he gave to me for this purpose.

At Etroite Isabel was joyous that her beloved lived still. The Lord of Etroite agreed to help the knights, arranging a night raft journey upriver to Ka’amalot where they found Lord Alain. Alain agreed to help but told the knights their parts were over unless they had a way to return to the Castle of Joy beyond the Wastelands - for though they could return to the City of Glass, they would not be able to take the same path they had taken previously. Chagrined they demanded the opportunity to join in the battle. Though it might risk their souls, he enjoined them to seek out the Wild Damosel.

Sir Maul and Dame Calliope used a pagan ritual at night to summon her. She took them on a long journey, along cliff faces, through valleys, and into ruined and wasted lands and cities. As they neared the boundary of the Wasteland she named the price for her guidance -
> I ask you now for the payment which I demanded: tell King Fisherman that I brought you here, and sent you to him, and what you promised me, and how I collected it. That is all. Tomorrow you will ride north, and with Goddess’ blessing find what you seek.


The next morning they did indeed find their way back to the Wastelands. They encountered the forces of the White Knight, marching to help King Fisherman. Joining with him they met Sir Bavid, brother to Sir Balin - who blamed the White Knight for his brother's death. The knights captured Bavid whose armies scattered, having marched to join the armies of Duke Klingsor, leader of those against King Fisherman.

The knights and their forces had to skirmish to regain entry to the Castle of Joy. They then visited Guinebaut, whose army had joined with Klingsor for the promised plunder - but not being an unjust man, was regretting this decision seeing the wicked goblins, Fomorians, and giants allied with Klingsor. An enemy of Alain nonetheless, they persuaded Guinebaut to withdraw his troops and come to an understanding with Alain after the battle.

The battle was enjoined earlier than planned, as the forces of Klingsor saw the knights working at fragmenting their forces. Lord Balor and his Fomorians attacked them. In a brutal battle that saw all injured, some near death, they and their armies slew many Fomorians and eventually did battle with Lord Balor, Fomorian lord himself. Heckle and Leofric near death, Calliope and Maul slew him despite their own wounds, Calliope hacking at him after his death.

The forces of the Castle of Joy victorious, the knights were healed in the chapel of the Holy Grail, or, as the pagans knew it, the Cauldron of Inspiration. Dame Brisen explained that though King Fisherman was not yet healed of his ailments, the victory assured that the Enchantment of Britain would increase greatly - and a savior might still return to the Castle of Joy to heal King Fisherman - perhaps one of the knights or their descendants.

## Year 516 - Chapter XXXV - March on Eburacum
With a Saxon army seizing Eburacum, Arthur hastily gathered a hundred knights, with his new bride to accompany the army, and marched on a mission of liberation.

With its headstrong attack, the army found itself ambushed at night, the knights of Robert rallying their forces and driving the ambushers back. Reaching Eburacum, they briefly besieged it but were forced to withdraw with the forces of Cerdic preparing to march on Arthur’s outnumbered troops.

After the inconclusive campaign, Robert sent his loyal knights to the land of Rydychan, where they held land, to arrange with the countess of Rydychan a bride.

Again Robert’s greatest knights accompanied Arthur in an attempt to liberate Eburacum. Calliope, Heckle, and Maul were joined by Elgan ap Leofric.

The Saxon horde, led by Cheldric, met Arthur’s army near Lincoln. In the battle, the knights of Salisbury battled some of the greatest forces of the Saxons, including berserkers.

Aided by the mysterious White Knight, Arthur’s forces were victorious and chased the remnants of Cheldric’s forces to the Caledonian Woods. There they encircled his forces with palisades and battled them as they tried to escape, the knights of Robert capturing Cheldric. Most of the Saxon army pledged to never take up arms against Britain again and retreated to the continent.

## Year 518 - Chapter XXXVII - The Battle of Badon Hill

![][image-5]


A great Saxon host had assembled, determined to remove Arthur. Aescwine of Essex, Ælle Bretwalda of Sussex, Chief Port of Sussex, Cwichelm of Anglia, Byrhtnoth of Sorestan, Yffi of Deira, Ælle of Kent and the dread Cerdic of Wessex had united their armies.

Over several days Arthur's forces battled with the Saxons and their allies. The knights of Robert - Calliope, Elgan, Heckle, and Maul - stopped Cerdic's forces at Amrosius' Dike, eventually slaying that enemy who had been a bane since the death of Uther. 

However, while Robert's knights stopped the southern foes, the hordes from the east had forced Arthur to retreat to the fort at Badon Hill. 

Robert's knights joined Arthur at Badon Hill. It was a long and bloody battle against Saxons, Pictish mercenaries, and giants. Robert's knights earned great glory fighting those foes, though Maul, nephew of Mag, fell in battle against King Ælle. So angry was his squire, Axel, the son of Mag, that the lad struck down King Ælle with the axe of Mag and Maul. The lad was knighted after the battle and inherited his father's land. Maul's wife tended to her late husband's estate with cattle and goats gifted to him by King Arthur at his wedding.
