#### Year 509 - Chapter XXVIII- The Battle of Sandford

King Cerdic always remembered those who fought against him and so it was that his son, Cynric, demanded triple the tribute from Countess Ellen - or a pledge of eternal fealty to Cerdic, King of Wessex.

Change was afoot in Salisbury, with Robert, son of Roderick, coming of age, to be knighted by the Lady Calliope. Ellen wished to give her son time to determine his own course of action and agreed to pay the tribute. Sirs Leofric and Heckle advocated for a subdued knighting ceremony while Maul suggested  a more elaborate one - though Leofric’s and Heckle’s arguments were so poor as to actually persuade Robert away from his initial instincts for a subdued ceremony to a more elaborate one, in the hopes of giving the people of Salisbury more hope.

Cerdic also demanded the yielding of Oxford and the other territories for Rydychan. However, the knights held those by right of conquest and they were not Ellen’s to choose what to do with. The knights chose to defend them, knowing it would soon mean battle with Cynric. As both the knights and Cynric were guests of Ellen, they did not go into open hostilities there - indeed, Calliope and Cynric exchanged threats veiled in pleasantries.

After Earl Robert’s knighting, the four knights quickly led their troops from Salisbury to Rydychan - accompanied by Earl Robert. However, at the crossing of the Thames at the small hamlet of Sandford they were overtaken by Cynric’s forces, who were waiting on the far side of the Thames. They engaged Cynric in battle, fighting over possession of a ruined watchtower on a small island. In a battle against Saxon warriors, Earl Robert, in his first true battle, was quickly disarmed and wounded, though his knights prevented him from being captured. Fighting their way up the tower, Maul and Heckle fought against Cynric’s elite troops, Heckle being previously injured by a Saxon berserker - possibly the same one who slew his father, while Calliope and Leforic battled their way past those troops to battle Cynric. Calliope and Cynric exchanged mighty blows, disarming each other. As they retrieved their weapons, Leofric and Cynric had a similar exchange, giving Calliope an opening for a lethal blow. As Cynric clung to life Maul hurled him down the steps of the tower, dying as he landed on one of his berserker’s axes.

With the defeat of Cynric the Saxon army withdrew. The knights and their earl returned to Sarum victorious.

## Year 510 - The Boy King
Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul accompanied young Earl Robert to the tournament at London. The tournament was a new thing - battle not to the death. It was a chaotic affair, something that the faerie folk would enjoy.

However, all was upended was a beardless bastard, Arthur, drew the sword Excalibur, from the sword it had been embedded in since the death of Uther. There were many witnesses, among them Merlin, back from his voyages. A small number of those swore immediate loyalty to Arthur, among them being King Leodegrance of Cameliard; Sir Ector, Arthur’s stepfather; Sir Kay, Arthur’s 
step-brother; Sir Hervis de Revil, a famous but landless knight; Prince Lanceor of Estregales, son of the King of Estregales; the famous Sir Brastias; Lady Calliope; Sir Heckle; Sir Leofric; and Sir Maul. Earl Robert was hesitant to swear loyalty, drawing the sword or no, and King Lot was adamant that a beardless bastard would never rule.

Merlin chose ten knights to guard the sword which was returned to the stone so that it could be drawn again for more witnesses - and again, none were able to draw it forth. Among the knights chosen for the honor of guarding the sword included Earl Robert’s knights.

On Candlemas, February 2, Arthur drew the sword again. More pledged their loyalty to him as king, to be known as the “Eager Vassals”. The Eager Vassals included young Earl Robert of Salisbury; Ulfius, Duke of Silchester; Duke Corneus of Lindsey; Bishop Baudwin of Britain; the Earl of Hertford; the Earl of Dorset; and many lesser lords and knights.

On Easter, Arthur drew the sword for a third time. This time, more of the rest of the Logres noblemen pledged their loyalty. They are called the “Good Vassals,” and include the Duke of Clarence; the Earl of Jagent; the Earl of Wuerensis; and many others.

In May, on Pentecost, Arthur drew the sword for a fourth time. He was knighted by Sir Brastias, an act Merlin found amusing. At St. Paul’s Cathedral he was coronated as King of Logres and there were great rejoicing, for the land had a king again.

The king and his retinue traveled to Carlion-on-Usk. There, on May 10 the Collegium assembled - or at least a majority of it did - and named Arthur the High King, the Pendragon. 

However, King Lot was not idle and had brought an army to contest Arthur. They besieged Carlion. Against the advice of his knights Arthur initially stayed behind the walls. Robert’s knights rode forth to assemble allies and did battle with King Lot. Though Arthur was inexperienced, with the aid of Merlin and his knights, was able to win an indecisive victory.  

That summer Arthur and his many knights stayed at Bedegraine Castle. Rumor had it he and the earl’s daughter, Lyzianor, had become fond of each other. As the summer waned, the knights heard reports that King Ryons of Norgales was raiding King Leodegrance of Cameliard. Given Leodegrance’s early allegiance, the knights of Salisbury helped drive off Ryon’s forces, capturing the mighty Sir Harte of the great antlered helm. 
  
There was much celebrating in the realm, for though the kingdom was not yet secure, for the first time in a generation there was a king…

## Year 511 - Retaking Cair Maug

The year 511 saw some much needed consolidation. Queen Margawse of Lothian was at the court at Carlion - rumor had it when she left she was with child.

Heckle had to defend his sister from accusations of being a horse thief, She pled that she was following the orders of another king the centaur king Agametrius, It seemed she might have lost her mind until the centaur king arrived in Carlion.

He explained that several sacred horses, blessed with speech, had been lost to humans. The knights agreed to help him and Heckle’s sister by leafing a raid on Cair Maug, the tower where Maug, uncle of Maul, had fallen in battle. The Saxons had recently retaken it, under Thane Alfred - mounted on a talking horse.

The knights were able to launch a surprise attack, bursting into the barracks on horseback. The battle within was furious, with a great fire breaking out and forcing them out. They slew Alfred and retook Cair Maug, though his nephew was badly wounded in the battle. Unlike his uncle, he survived the surgeon’s knife.
