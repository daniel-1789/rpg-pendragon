# The Great Pendragon Campaign Recap - The Grail Quest


![Pendragon Players' Map][image-1]



## Year 554 - Chapter LXXVIII - The Grail Quest Begins

Camelot was quite busy, with Lancelot, rarely seen at court, present. 

The Knight Bela was named to the Round Table. While there she saw the seat that had long been labeled Siege Perilous now indicated it was reserved for Sir Galahad. 

Much to the chagrin of the Pentecost Feasters it took forever for the feast to start, with many false starts. A sword in a stone that none could free, despite the likes of Gawaine and John Snow and Maug trying. Eventually Galahad showed up and claimed the sword, stating it was the sword of Sir Basin, who wounded Galahad’s grandfather, the Fisher King - and slew Balin’s brother, triggering the Enchantment of Britain. It would not be until the Holy Grail could be found that the Fisher King could be healed. “Soon may that be” the aged King Arthur said.

Arthur called a joust in honor of this (still no feast). Maug, though not known for his skill with the lance, unhorsed Sir Lancelot. Gawaine was unhorsed by Sir Lewys, though Galahad was in the end victorious. 

As they prepared again for the feast, The Emperor Yesterday, Puck, arrived from the Faerie Land. He stated that the Faerie Court would soon be departing Britain, for the finding of the Grail would end the Enchantment of Britain. 

They then readied for the feast. But then an image of the Holy Grail appeared before them. Sir Gawaine, and soon all the Round Table Knights, and most of the knights present, swore they would quest for it, not returning home. Men of King Mark took special note that Arthur’s knights were all going to be a-questing…

Arthur himself wept, knowing many of those knights questing would never return and his realm would never be the same…

## Year 555 - Chapter LXXIX - The Invasion of King Mark

After decades of peace, Arthur’s Britain was under invasion. While the knights of the Round Table - and many of his other greatest knights - were questing for the the Holy Grail, King Mark seized the opportunity to invade, using weapons of dark magic and science.

With many of the greatest knights of Earl Robert questing, others of his realm were forced to step up. They included:
- Sir Percy, cousin to John Snow
- Lady Morgana, daughter of Lilith and wife of Bela
- Sir Axel, faerie knight and father of Sir Maug II
- Sir Eliver ap Elidir, holy Christian knight, brother of Lewys

Sir Mark’s weapon was shown to be able to easily blast holes in the stoutest of gates. As the invasion headed for Salisbury, Percy, Morgana, Axel, and Oliver assembled what forces they could to drive them off. They battled their way through Cornish knights and Saxon mercenaries to at last destroy the weapon and protect the realm. 

King Mark was forced to retreat, though not before he captured his estranged wife, Isolde, from her lover, Sir Tristan.

## Year 556 - Chapter LXXX - The Portal to Avalon

The quest for the grail was a brutal one. The unlabeled chairs at the Round Table told the tale of many dead knights. The kingdom had been left unprotected from King Mark’s attacks. And rumor had it that Lancelot himself had been lost.

And yet Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug continued the search, even as their loved ones and kin protected the land from King Mark.

Their journey took them to a path that descended into the Earth, into the Faerie realms, guarded by a fiendish troll. Did they need to go there? Was the path to the grail through the Fae realms. Most felt unsure, but Bela had business to conduct there. Believing the prophecy that the end of the reign of Arthur was drawing near and her people needed to be protected. They vanquished the fiend, battling it without armor, as divine inspiration told them whatever they wore would add to its power. 

King Today greeted them and told them that he was indeed willing to shelter any of their people should the unthinkable happen. Yet when the grail was found the most of the connections between the realms would close. But… If there were to be an island in Avalon, near Calmann, peopled by Faerie, tended by them and their livestock, that portal would remain open.

They treated with Puck who had a group of peasants and some hardy faerie livestock that he agreed to part with them if those peasants who came across later would give their allegiance to the Faerie Folk.

King Today also prophesied the location of the Grail, warning them not to allow any knight who battled them in to escape out a door and return, to always wear their armor when being tested.

Upon returning to Britain they traveled with their Fae caravan to Calmann, though en route they were attached by a fiendish knight and his devil dog. They battled their way past both and then secured Lady Nimue’s permission that the Fae folk and their livestock could settle there.

## Year 557 - Chapter LXXXI - The Grail Feast
> At the Castle of Joy they rode through the besieging armies and met with King Fisherman, greatly wounded. Calliope asked what ailed him and how they could help - unknowingly the first question required to heal him, though she didn’t have the religious conviction to help him further. Perhaps at a later time a knight - perhaps one of them - could use the Holy Grail to heal him. 

- Year 514

Bela, daughter of Gawaine, had been married to Callope’s grandson and later her granddaughter, Morgana. She had long heard tales of Calliope’s failure to gain the grail and growing up with the grandchildren of Calliope, had pledged to someday be worthy.

And so it was at long last that Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug, descendants of those bold adventurers,  came to the Castle of Adventure, our world’s mirror of the Castle of Joy. King Pellam warned them against the final steps in the quest. Few knights had reached this point. And all who tried to go beyond failed, most dying. 
  
Yet they would not be deterred. Individually they faced their challenges. Their beds tried to throw them off and attack them. A lion charged in to do battle with them. A knight. All suffered greatly, Lewys nearly killed, but for his brave squire who fought to keep him alive. 

Surviving the brutal night, they were taken to the Grail Feast. With Bela, John, and Maug at head table, along with Sir Galahad, tending the ailing Fisher King (though their sires had claimed he was one and the same as King Pellam). The injured Sir Lewys was nearby, recovering, though he saw to it his noble squire be knighted for his valor. 

Though the three at the table all attempted to ask the questions to heal the Fisher King it was Bela who managed to utter all of them. 

What ails thee? 

My grief is multiple: The ghastly wound I bear grieves me. The sin that caused my wound grieves me. But these are not the worst sorrow, which comes from the negligence which outsiders have shown to me. But you alone, of all the outer world, has shown me compassion, and I welcome you now, Healer!


Whom does the Grail serve? 
 
The Grail serves the Grail King. And the Grail King serves all of us, mankind and the rest of the world. 

How may I help thee? 

Your question alone has been the help which I have awaited, O Healer. The attention and concern of the outer world has been that which I needed for help. 

What is the Secret of the Grail?
 
The Grail has no form nor shape, except that which we need to bring us onward and outward to find peace and wholeness in the world. 

With that the grail did appear and its blood brought healing to all. Not just the Fisher King but all present, including Lewys. They learned that the realm itself was healed by the germination of the Grail.
  
Returning to Camelot in glory they saw Arthur too was healed, no longer appearing an ancient man but rather a healthy 65, his true age. Lancelot returned as well. However not all was well. Tristam and Isolt had died and King Mark had them buried far apart from one another. And it seemed the Enchantment of Britain was over and History returning. Save for one last portal in Avalon…
