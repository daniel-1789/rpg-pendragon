## Year 531 - Chapter L - Camille's Rebellion

Rebellion was again brewing in Anglia, with Heckle's Beacon having been taken by Saxons. This was an affront that could not stand - especially in the eyes of the knight Lady Matilda, who took time from courting Sir Borre, bastard son of King Arthur (considered by many - including himself - the most likely heir).

Cutting through the swamp near the tower, the knight did battle with the Saxons within, eventually securing their surrender and exile. However, the main part of the Saxon forces were within the swamp - and a castle had mysteriously appeared within that swamp, protected by animated flowers and enchanted suits of armor. They learned from the lady Nimue the sorceress Camille was behind this, a powerful shapeshifter who would be healed of any injury when she assumed a new shape - but she would need to remove and don her enchanted cap to do so.

Expeditions from the castle captured King Arthur - an unacceptable turn of events. Dealing with the enchanted flowers, Robert's knights were able to draw Camille and her forces out to do battle - and through a grievous battle that injured Axel, Elgan, and Lilith, and nearly slew Matilda, they were able to defeat her and destroy her books, rescuing Arthur. Nimue treated their injuries with her own sorcery.
