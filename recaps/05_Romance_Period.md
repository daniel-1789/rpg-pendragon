## Year 531 - Chapter L - Camille's Rebellion

Rebellion was again brewing in Anglia, with Heckle's Beacon having been taken by Saxons. This was an affront that could not stand - especially in the eyes of the knight Lady Matilda, who took time from courting Sir Borre, bastard son of King Arthur (considered by many - including himself - the most likely heir).

Cutting through the swamp near the tower, the knight did battle with the Saxons within, eventually securing their surrender and exile. However, the main part of the Saxon forces were within the swamp - and a castle had mysteriously appeared within that swamp, protected by animated flowers and enchanted suits of armor. They learned from the lady Nimue the sorceress Camille was behind this, a powerful shapeshifter who would be healed of any injury when she assumed a new shape - but she would need to remove and don her enchanted cap to do so.

Expeditions from the castle captured King Arthur - an unacceptable turn of events. Dealing with the enchanted flowers, Robert's knights were able to draw Camille and her forces out to do battle - and through a grievous battle that injured Axel, Elgan, and Lilith, and nearly slew Matilda, they were able to defeat her and destroy her books, rescuing Arthur. Nimue treated their injuries with her own sorcery.

## Year 532 - Chapter LI - Robbers and Giants of Wales

Changes were afoot in the membership of Robert's core knights. Sir Elgan had retired to his estate, with his heir Elidir ap Elgan being knighted. Lady Lilith, in thanks for assisting in the rescue of Arthur from Camille's Rebellion, was named to the Round Table, joining Sir Axel.

Robber knights in Wales had behaved in an abominable manner, stealing jewels from the estate of the Queen's late mother. With Sir Axel traveling to King Joran to discuss wedding his second daughter, herself recently widowed, the four pledged to hunt the robber knights.

On their way to the robber knights they met a lad who knew nothing about the knighthood and asked them countless questions, pledging he would one day be a knight.

They eventually encountered the robber knights, with Matilda convincing two to forsake their wicked ways and submit to Arthur's mercy. They joined in defeating their former comrades, though one paid penance with his life.

King Joran was amendable to his daughter wedding Sir Axel should they perform the small service of slaying the giant Logrin - a giant rumored to only be slain by one with the blood of Arthur. Slew him they did, with ease, though rumor had it he rose from the dead the following spring, a new giant sprouting from his corpse.

In Camelot a king from the faerie met with Arthur, indicating that with barriers breaking down the adventurers of his world felt free to quest in Arthur's realm. Arthur granted that permission, though indicated his people would do likewise.

Before departing Britain, the knights saved a magical hare from a mystical hound hunting it.

In Paris, a great tournament was held to celebrate the wedding.

## Year 534 - Chapter LIII - A Song of Rabbits and Wine

The Kingdom was a peace. King Arthur indicated that it was time for knights to engage in the court of romance were they not otherwise engaged in adventure.

However, there was a problem. King Louis Merovingian had blocked the transport of wine from Italy and other lands through France to Britain. An opportunity for adventure! Sir Gawain gladly joined with the knights of Robert on this grand adventure.

Traveling to Paris, a city many of them had participated in conquering some years ago, they were admitted to the court of the king. He agreed he would reopen trade for at least five years were they to rid him of a beast that had plagued the land of Caerbannog.

Traveling down a canyon, they found bones and armor of many warriors who had made the same attempt. A small rabbit appeared to be the beast, though it was an enchanted hare. It nearly killed Gawain in a single blow and leapt from Matilda to Lilith to Axel to Elidir and back again. In a bloody battle they eventually dispatched the fell beast, treated their injuries (and Gawain's), and severed the rabbits four feet to take as charms.

Returning to Britain with a supply of wine, they joined Arthur's court at a great tournament. Still recovering from their grievous injuries, they were content to watch this tournament. The melee saw Sir Mordred victorious, though he fought like a wild man possessed of a great demon - hurling his helmet at one foe to batter him senseless. Even Sir Lancelot seemed to avoid him...

## Year 535 - Chapter LIV - The Year of the Basket Knight and Cerridwen's Revenge

At the Queen's court an anonymous, black-armored knight, seeking to challenge Arthur's knights, splashed wine on the Queen. As the knights debated who should respond to this insult in arrived the lad they had met in the year 532, now clad in a wicker suit of armor. He swore he would avenge the queen's armor. Before they could stop him he followed the black knight and when they caught up to him, the knight was slain.

Prior to this, Sir Kay, Arthur's foster brother, had insulted both the queen's dwarfs and the lad, named Percivale, seventh and last surviving son of King Pellinore. The lad departed in search of adventure, though Percivale swore he would meet Sir Kay in battle to avenge his injury to the dwarfs. 

The knights joined in a pursuit of the lad, for Arthur sought to learn more of him. However, their search was interrupted by a diversion into Faerie, where a shapeshifting woman swore she would have their revenge on them - for the knights had stopped her two years ago in when she was hunting a hare. 

When they refused to battle for eternity to make up for her loss she tried reigning magic on them, though their rabbit's foots acquired last year protected them. So she unleashed a horrid boar to wreak havoc on their lands - and then transformed into an elephant-sized hound and tried to slay the knights in her mighty jaws. After a mighty battle they had defeated her but they were unable to find the boar.

That winter they learned the queen's cousin, whom they had escorted to her wedding in France, was being held a prisoner. Arthur warned them to prepare for war.

## Year 537 - Chapter LVI - The Adventure of the Werewolf

At Camelot, a great tournament prior to the Pentecost feast was held. The knights Elidir and Matilda earned great honor being the final two knights in the great joust, with Elidir eventually unhorsing Matilda - but an outcome which brought great honor to their liege-lord, Earl Robert. 

The knights Axel and Lilith instead participated in a hunt. The hunt ended with an encounter with a strange wolf, one that frightened their horses, causing Axel to be unhorsed. The wolf was accosting Sir Guaire, one of Duke Galahaut’s men. However, with the arrival of Sir Axel and Dame Lilith brought about a change in behavior - the wolf sat respectfully and properly at their feet. Guaire insisted it be destroyed but the wolf accompanied Lilith back to Camelot.

The well-behaved wolf caused a sensation in Camelot and greatly pleased King Arthur, who always insisted upon witnessing a miracle before Pentecost. He charged them to solve the mystery of this well-mannered wolf, that Lilith had named Bear. 

At the Pentecost Feast Earl Robert’s knights investigated, though it was Lilith, whose shield device was a great dog, had the most interest. Elidir enjoyed having some time at court with his beloved cousin. However, all became more involved as they began uncovering the mystery. 

They learned that while the wolf, named Bear by Lilith, was friendly to almost all, it did not care for Sir Guaire, nor the Lady Indeg, the presumed widow of the knight of the round table Sir Marrok, missing seven years ago.

During the feast they learned that Indeg wished for her husband to be declared dead so she could be with her lover, Sir Guaire. They also learned they had begun this affair before the loss of Marrok. And it turned out Marrok’s family had a curse that turned the men to wolves on certain nights - they would return to human form if they had their human clothing available.

Further investigation showed Marrok’s manor empty of all his clothing - and they learned Guiare had an abandoned castle he took his lovers to. Matilda searched for and found Marrok’s clothing in that castle whilst the others subdued Guaire. 

Returning to Camelot with the clothing the wolf initially refused to make use of it until given privacy. When given it, it did indeed transform into a sleeping Sir Marrok.

King Arthur was angered by this betrayal, feeling Indeg and Guaire’s adultery, while bad, was worsened by trapping Marrok in wolf form, an attempt at murdering his human form. While Earl Robert’s knights urged mercy, Arthur made an example of such betrayal and sentenced them to death.

## Year 538 - Chapter LVII - The Abduction of the Queen
A page brought to Camelot the horrible news - Queen Guenever, while a-Maying, had been abducted - as had her entire entourage. Lancelot was already in pursuit and soon Axel, Elidir, Lilith, and Matilda joined him.

They found she had been taken by Sir Meliagrance and surrounded his Somerset Castle. Fighting their way to it, Lancelot challenged Meliagrance to a duel and was victorious, granting mercy to the knight who claimed to have been helpless against the queen’s beauty. 

However, the entourage was en route to the coast, to be sold to Saxons. Axel, Elidir, Lilith, and Matilda pursued them while Lancelot stayed at the castle. They defeated Meliagrance’s allies in battle, despite their attempt at flanking them, capturing their leader, Sir Iago, and rescuing the party.

Returning to the castle they found Lancelot had slain Meliagrance for the accusing the queen of adultery with a wounded knight, finding blood in her chambers.
