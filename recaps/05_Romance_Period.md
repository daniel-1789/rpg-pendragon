## Year 531 - Chapter L - Camille's Rebellion

Rebellion was again brewing in Anglia, with Heckle's Beacon having been taken by Saxons. This was an affront that could not stand - especially in the eyes of the knight Lady Matilda, who took time from courting Sir Borre, bastard son of King Arthur (considered by many - including himself - the most likely heir).

Cutting through the swamp near the tower, the knight did battle with the Saxons within, eventually securing their surrender and exile. However, the main part of the Saxon forces were within the swamp - and a castle had mysteriously appeared within that swamp, protected by animated flowers and enchanted suits of armor. They learned from the lady Nimue the sorceress Camille was behind this, a powerful shapeshifter who would be healed of any injury when she assumed a new shape - but she would need to remove and don her enchanted cap to do so.

Expeditions from the castle captured King Arthur - an unacceptable turn of events. Dealing with the enchanted flowers, Robert's knights were able to draw Camille and her forces out to do battle - and through a grievous battle that injured Axel, Elgan, and Lilith, and nearly slew Matilda, they were able to defeat her and destroy her books, rescuing Arthur. Nimue treated their injuries with her own sorcery.

## Year 532 - Chapter LI - Robbers and Giants of Wales

Changes were afoot in the membership of Robert's core knights. Sir Elgan had retired to his estate, with his heir Elidir ap Elgan being knighted. Lady Lilith, in thanks for assisting in the rescue of Arthur from Camille's Rebellion, was named to the Round Table, joining Sir Axel.

Robber knights in Wales had behaved in an abominable manner, stealing jewels from the estate of the Queen's late mother. With Sir Axel traveling to King Joran to discuss wedding his second daughter, herself recently widowed, the four pledged to hunt the robber knights.

On their way to the robber knights they met a lad who knew nothing about the knighthood and asked them countless questions, pledging he would one day be a knight.

They eventually encountered the robber knights, with Matilda convincing two to forsake their wicked ways and submit to Arthur's mercy. They joined in defeating their former comrades, though one paid penance with his life.

King Joran was amendable to his daughter wedding Sir Axel should they perform the small service of slaying the giant Logrin - a giant rumored to only be slain by one with the blood of Arthur. Slew him they did, with ease, though rumor had it he rose from the dead the following spring, a new giant sprouting from his corpse.

In Camelot a king from the faerie met with Arthur, indicating that with barriers breaking down the adventurers of his world felt free to quest in Arthur's realm. Arthur granted that permission, though indicated his people would do likewise.

Earl Robert's loyal knights, Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda escorted the queen's cousin, Lady Elyzabel, to Paris for her wedding to Lord Phillip, cousin to the French King. En route they jousted elf knights who had begun adventuring in Arthur's Britain.

Before departing Britain, the knights saved a magical hare from a mystical hound hunting it.

In Paris, a great tournament was held to celebrate the wedding.
