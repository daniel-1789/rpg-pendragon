![Pendragon Players' Map][image-1]

## Year 519 - Chapter XXXVIII - The Battle of Alcuid
![Britain_519][image-2]
The year of our Lord 519 saw rebellion in Anglia and a combined Pict and Irish invasion in Alcuid. Arthur marched north to Alcuid to deal with an invasion to his realm while Duke Hervis relentlessly clamped down on the rebellion. News from France told a sad tale of the conquest of Ganis, with no lords or heirs surviving.

The veteran knights Calliope and Heckle accompanied Arthur, along with the younger knights Axel and Elcard. There they helped break the siege of Alcuid and pursued the attacking Picts back to their own land, retreating to the islands of Loch Lomond. A Christian monk persuaded Arthur to have mercy so he could convert the pagan Picts and so redeem their heathen souls.

## Year 520 - Chapter XXXIX - Building Camelot
After years of warfare, Calliope and Heckle took advantage of the opportunity for a summer spent garrisoned at the building site for Arthur's capital at the abandoned Caer Gwent, to be renamed Calemot, accompanied by the younger knights Elgan and Axel. Duke Hervis spent the summer brutally putting down a rebellion, resulting in the deaths of many loyal subjects of Arthur.

The summer, though not deadly, was a strange one. The knights met the talking eagle, Eliwod, bearing a warning for King Arthur that pride was the fault of the Pendragons. Taking Arthur to the bird, it repeated its warning, revealing it was once a human, the bastard son of Prince Madoc.

Near Caer Gwent a minor lord patrolled his land, challenging all knights to joust, taking their beards as forfeit. Though a bizarre custom, it could not be allowed to persist and embarrass Arthur. The knights took the initiative and defeated the lord and his knights in jousting, sending them away.

However, one of the vanquished knights was slain in a nearby marsh by a giant bird, a boobrie, possessing a hellish shriek that terrified man and beast alike and vicious talons and beak. They slew the foul beast, helping secure Arthur's land.

## Year 521 - Chapter XL - Morgan le Fey's Betrayal

Accompanying Arthur on a hunting expedition, the knights Axel, Calliope, Elgan, and Heckle were separated from Arthur. Searching for him, they heard a voice from under the earth and learned Merlin had been trapped in eternal sleep down there - though he was still aware of events and guided them to Arthur.

They were reunited with Arthur when they found he had been tricked into fighting Sir Acclon, who had been given Excalibur by Arthur's half-sister, Morgan le Fey. She had stolen both the sword and its scabbard. Arthur, though badly wounded and needing healing by Nimue, one of the Ladies of the Lake, slew a repentant Sir Acclon who had been tricked as well.

At Arthur's bidding, the four knights helped Arthur pursue his sister, battling a mysterious Fachan she had sent in their path - and that tried to slay the king.

They lost track of Morgan in a field of standing stones. They then remembered  the eagle's prophecy - “You will almost die, and then find yourself lost among a field of stones.” 

Back at Camelot an envoy of Morgan presented a cloak to Arthur as a gift to make amends. However, Arthur's knights warned him against that and urged the envoy to put it on. She did so and died a horrible death, revealing Morgan's further treachery.

Arthur banished Morgan and her son, Yvaine, from the kingdom, though he allowed King Uriens, her husband to remain. Gawaine, cousin of Yvaine, departed the court as well.

In thanks for their years of service, being among the first to recognize him as king, and their efforts against Morgan, King Arthur decreed that the Lady Calliope, daughter of Boudica, and Sir Heckle, son of Adric, be named Knights of the Round Table.

## Year 522 - Chapter XLI - The Adventure of the Dolorous Worm
![dolorous_wyrm][image-3]

With relative peace in the land, the knights Axel, Calliope, Elgan, and Heckle sought adventure in the lands of Cambria. They found themselves lost in the Forest of Dean. Emerging in a meadow, they found a strange sight - a sheep that changed color as it crossed a stream. A shepherd told them that they were in the land of the King of Suffering, whose true name and title was Caradoc, King of Ergyng. They traveled to the king's Hereford Castle where the aged, one-eyed king told them many tales. He told them of the many fell beasts which had come down on his kingdom, especially a giant.

The next day the four knights went out to slay the creature. On their way they found a woman emerging from an eternally burning, but never consumed, tree. She was Bayanne, Princess of the Tree. She said she recognized Sir Heckle and Lady Calliope from the Battle of the Castle of Joy, where they released the Enchantment of Britain. Because of this, she told them where the giant, Grung, could be found. His lair was a burial chamber   - a giant shield-like platform supported by columns with the chamber beneath. Grung stood atop the platform. The knights battled him, with Calliope stuck by a great melancholy as she tried to cling to memories of her family to aid her in the battle. In the end they defeated the giant and claimed one of its treasures, the sword Wyrmbane, its name wrought in Ogham symbols which Bayanne translated for them. 

King Caradoc feasted them and told them more tales, including that of a stone that a virtuous High King could use to summon an armful of gold daily. A stone possessed by a fire-breathing warm. Caradoc thought perhaps one day he could acquire it but his effort resulted in the deaths of his sons and the loss of his eye. But perhaps the knights could deal with it and present the stone to Arthur...

En route to the warm they supped at Clifford, Castle of the Lady of Feats, Lady Fenew. They challenged her knights to battle to first touch, some victorious, some vanquished, but all gaining glory in the effort. She told them where the warm could be found - in the ruins of a nearby church. The serving boy, the Clever Jack, told them of how it might be fought - how it hated the color red. How it could perhaps be captured with iron hooks.
\
They concocted an elaborate plan where they would bait the dragon while Jack prepared a red straw dummy with hidden hooks. However, the plan was unneeded for the knights were valiant and, armed with Wyrmbane, Elgan struck the killing blow. 

Returning, King Caradoc feasted them again and, with no sons, his eldest daughter was wed to the widowed Sir Axel. 

They returned to Camelot where they presented the stone to King Arthur. He was able to use its wondrous magics to summon gold, a feat that could make him tremendously wealthy. He pledged his thanks to the good knights, with Sirs Axel and Elgan joining Sir Heckle and Lady Calliope at the Round Table.

A wondrous event occurred at court. An elderly fisherman arrived with several boys. He explained how he had raised them when they were washed ashore several years ago. However, he recently learned they had come from Britain. A note, one he could not reveal, showed them to be the children lost a decade ago, including Mordred, son of King Lot and Margawse, daughter of Uther Pendragon.

## Year 523 - Chapter XLII - The Quest of the Red Blade

The knights Axel, Calliope, Elgan, and Heckle had traveled in search of adventure and were guests of Sir Gregor of Stafford. He told them a wonderful tale, that of the Red Blade.
> A magical sword is in the possession of an evil king at the Castle of the Kite, a fortress in western Cambria. The king is reputed to use evil magic to maintain his youth, though no one knows what kind of magic specifically. Whoever gets the sword would benefit greatly, and the world would be a better place without this vile king.
![red_blade_lands][image-4]

The four swore a quest to retrieve the Red Blade and vanquish the vile king. En route, they stayed as guests of the Castle of the Crane, King Garan. He told how King Calawader of the Castle of the Kite was distant kin of his - the son of a forefather. The evil king had used magic to extend his life for well over a century while remaining young. Though he was supposed to inherit land of his father, Calawader's brother was the possessor of a wondrous red blade. Calawader had stolen it from his brother and slew all his brother's descendants who tried to take it. 

King Garan offered to help them and asked only in return if they were to gain the blade, that they pass here on their way home and let him gaze upon it - he would make no claim on it so long it were parted from the vile Calawader.

He outfitted them with stout mountain ponies for all who would have them and gave them a guide to the Castle of the Kite. They learned King Calawader was indeed unpopular, meeting Sir Band and knights of Gomeret marching on the Castle of the Kite. They declined to join those knights, instead knocking on the gates of the castle.
![castle_of_the_kite][image-5]

King Calawader saw them - he was a vile, potbellied man of many years. His knights served him but did not love him. Learning of the marching knights of Gomeret he demanded his visitors swear loyalty to him, something they would not do. Angrily, he ordered his men to slay the knights.

As the battle raged, King Calawader tried to run. He held his Red Blade to a pigboy and swore he would kill the boy. Refusing to give in, Sir Axel hurled the Lady Calliope through the air at King Calawader, impaling him. 

Slaying they king, they learned the pigboy was his son - and was to be slain in any case, for he would consume the flesh of his son to regain his youth, as he had done many times. Putting the boy on the throne that was his they rode home, visiting King Garan. The king was tempted to break his vow and take the sword but the giant crane over his castle, that was his family's symbol of honor, looked down upon him and he agreed if the sword were to come back to him it would do so another route.

In Camelot they learned much of the news of the year. The ancient Brastias retiring at long last. Arthur granting land to one of the rescued children, his nephew Mordred. The rebellion of the sons of Ulfius.

## Year 524 - Chapter XLIII - The Knight of the Lake

In the Year of Our Lord 524, a new set of squires were being knighted. Among them was Lilith, daughter of Calliope, and a mysterious man presented by the Lady of the Lake, Nimue - known only as the Squire of the Lake. Arthur was hesitant to knight a man he did not know, with arms and armor provided by the Lady of the Lake, but Axel, Elgan, and Heckle convinced him that the magical lady's wishes should be respected.

There was some confusion after the knighting, with the newly knighted Knight of the Lake leaving the ceremony prior to his sword being girded - removing spears and blades from an injured knight, agreeing to go on an unspecified mission of vengeance (one Arthur had recommended against, given the lack of its specifics).

The three older knights - led by Heckle, who had witnessed the drawing of the Sword from the Stone, accompanied Lilith and the Knight of the Lake to help Nohaut drive off forces from Northumberland. The young Knight of the Lake proved himself in battle and the five charged into the Dolorous Garde. There they battled giants, spectral knights, lions, and an evil sorcerer who grievously injured the Knight of the Lake, requiring a healing draught from Lilith to recover. The sorcerer withdrew before their onslaught and pulling the knight free from metal spikes they released a stone with the knight's name hidden beneath - Lancelot, son of King Ban.

## Year 525 - Chapter XLIV - Beachhead in France
At Camelot, emissaries from the Roman Emperor arrived to demand tribute from King Arthur. In council with his knights, Arthur decided to claim right to the Imperial Crown by virtue of his ancestors, including Constantine, Emperor of Rome. He told the emissaries he demanded fealty from the Emperor or his forces would go to war. And so war was declared.

While most of Britain prepared for war, Axel, Elgan, Heckle, and Lilith led an expedition to the Norman coast to establish a beachhead. In the choppy seas they ran aground and seized a signal beacon atop a tower to stop other ships from meeting the same fate. Overcoming knights defending the tower, they accepted surrender from their leader Sir Geoffroi. As the nearby village gathered its forces, Axel, Elgan, and Lilith battled them while Heckle watched over the defeated knights. One of their number, Sir Josse, not believing a word to British knights binding, tried to stab Sir Heckle but was stopped and bound in chains.

Victorious, the knights left soldiers behind while they returned to their estates to prepare for war.

## Year 526 - Chapter XLV - War in France
![france_gaul][image-6]


In France, the knights Axel, Elgan, Heckle, and Lilith for a time found themselves on sentry duty. Sharing a camp with Arthur they one day discovered their liege had gone missing. Investigating, they found he had gone hunting giants and was engaged in battle against a great and mighty one. Of course King Arthur did not need their aid but two treacherous giants were attempting to join in. And there the knights could render aid without fear.

After much fighting in the countryside, Paris surrendered to Arthur's army, Lord Robert's knights making initial contact with the wealthy of the city who arranged it. They further accompanied Sir Gawaine to a parley with Emperor Lucius. The parley went poorly and Gawaine slew Sir Gainus, cousin to the emperor. Guest obligations destroyed, a melee broke out, with the British knights forced to flee.

Gawaine led his pursuers into an ambush, one the Knights of Robert felt less than honorable. However, after battle began they aided Sir Gawaine and his troops. The battle was brutal, with troops from across the Mediterranean, Cataphracts and true centuries making use of the tactics that had once brought Rome the known world. Sirs Heckle and Elgan were most previously injured, close to death, but the British drove off the Roman pursuit.

After being able to heal for two months, the armies again marched, battling Emperor Lucius in a narrow valley at Battle of Saussy. The British were victorious, with King Arthur slaying the Emperor.

With the passes through the Alps being covered with snow, the season for war had come to an end. Arthur ordered Lucius's body sent to Rome with full honors along with a warning to surrender.

## Year 527 - Chapter XLVI - Emperor of Rome
As the Alps thawed, Arthur led his army across. Earl Robert's loyal knights participated in the Siege of Milan. Though victorious, the encounter was nearly fatal for Sir Heckle, who was most previously wounded in the attack.

Working their way south they were eventually met by bishops and senators from Rome who had agreed to surrender to Arthur, with the pope to coronate him as emperor.

Victoriously, the knights marched into Rome where Arthur was indeed coronated Roman Emperor. With time to spend in Rome, the knights did become aware that that title meant much less than it might have, with much of the city empty and many of Rome's great engineering marvels being used for their materials.

The knights undertook a dangerous sea journey home, with much illness suffered by the knights.

## Year 528 - Chapter XLVII - The Adventure of the Rosebriar Knight

While the kingdom was a relative peace, there was still plenty of adventure for bold knights. Wanting to shed themselves of the likes of Lancelot and Gawaine, Robert's knights travelled to Cornwall to investigate reports of vile practices, including human sacrifice.

At a cottage near the Exe River the knights found signs the rumors were true, encountering a squire being healed by old Mother Yarrow. As he recovered, she showed the knights her garden, blessed with beautiful flowers - likely blessed owing to a nearby well that showed signs of leading to the faery realms.

The squire was Jakin who had been traveling with Sir Dray and several other knights ho were traveling to the town of Padstow where, rumor had it, every year on Mayday a maiden was sacrificed at the orders of the local lord Sir Garowin - an unwed maiden of the town would chosen to become the
Bride of the Thorn, taken to a place near the edge of Morris Forest
And tied to a pole of thorns. There she
Would remain, her flesh pierced by the long barbed
thorns of the pole until her body is drained of
blood.

However the knights never made it, encountering a haunting, sorrowful wail followed by the attack of a giant, of which Jakin was the lone survivor.

With Mayday fast approaching they rode to the village, stopping only to supervise the burial of the knights. They found the tales were true.

Sir Garowin, a strange knight whose flesh was pierced by thorns, would only free the maiden, already tied to the pole and slowly bleeding, if a knight were to challenge him, wagering their knighthood and agreeing to acquire the next year's sacrifice. However the parley was interrupted by a ghostly wail and Grown returned to his castle.

Speaking with the maiden's family they learned that custom had it that Garowin could only be slain by his enemy Sir Daye, imprisoned in the Morris Forest behind a wall of thorns. Garowin stole Daye's faithful wife from him and then had her slay herself - supposedly the wail they kept hearing was her vengeful spirit.

Their blades were to no avail against either the thorns piercing the still-living maiden nor those blocking the path to Sir Daye. Sensing faery magic they retuned to the well to the faery realm. There they met the Queen of Spring who knew of and hated Garowin who stole a black rose that could allow him to force the affection of the other, what he used to steal Sir Daye's wife - though when he tired of her he had her shed all her own blood to prove her devotion.

In return for retrieving the stolen black rose she gave the knights enchanted thorn swords which they were able to use to free Sir Daye. Greatly weakened, he was unable to finish his battle with Garowin, though Sir Heckle and Lady Lilith took up his cause as their own and slew the vile Sir Garowin.

## Year 529 - Chapter XLVIII - Bran's Head and Rebellion
There was a tale that so long as the head of Bran stayed buried, Britain would be safe from invasion. King Arthur decreed that such pagan magic was not needed and they would unearth that skull from outside its burial just outside of London.

The unearthing was a moment of horror, with a vast pit needed to unearth the head, it being the size of a full human. And it did not want to be unearthed. The weather turned foul and the dead emerged from the earth to stop the head from being lifted. In the end, through the bravery of Earl Robert's knights was the skull winched from its burial. As they heaved it the skull spoke, demanding they leave it be. Once unearthed, it declared the doom of Britain - "The Doom of Britain is awakened. The King 
of the Bears cannot live forever. The Spring always 
follows the Winter, and the Destroyer is already born 
who will make women weep to remember this unholy 
uncovering. I see them who will glory at this deed: 
Ceawlin and Cutha, Melehan and his father.” 

Arthur shook his head, as if waking 
from a dream, and raised his voice: “The land must be 
held by courage and strength, not old magics. This is 
the New Age. This is the Age of Men.” 

However no sooner had he said that and prepared for a celebratory tournament did Sir Gawaine approach the king with a message from Sir Brastias. The King relayed the news to his subjects - "lords and ladies, we have received terrible news in triple. The Saxons of Anglia have risen in 
rebellion. And Irish raiders are burning the country-
side all along the Demetian and Severn Seas. 

“In light of these difficulties, the tournament is 
cancelled. All knights present must report to quarters for duty on the morrow. Counselors, report to 
my chambers.” 

Lady Lilith joined Arthur's main force and aided in the defense of the western shores while Sirs Axel, Elgan, and Heckle traveled to the lane or Anglia to free Yarmouth from Saxons.

In the Battle of Yarmouth Sir Heckle fell in battle with the Saxon berserker leader, Éadláf. Heckle skewered the fearsome berserker in a lance charge, but in his dying breath Éadláf slew Heckle. In his memory, Heckle's Beacon was built along the shore to stand sentry for Saxon invaders.

That winter the last of the British forces departed Rome, with Rome denying any loyalty to Arthur.

## Year 530 - Chapter XLIX - The Irish War

In year 530, many squires were knighted. Among them were Borre, bastard son of King Arthur; Matilda, daughter of the late Sir Heckle; Loholt, another bastard of Arthurs; and Mordred, youngest son of the late King Lot and one of the babies lost at sea and later recovered.

At court, Queen Guenevere's rules for Courtly Romance received codification. The visiting King Joran jousted many knights and then grappled, lifted, and rode off with Sir Gawaine. (Much to the chagrin of his rival the Lady Lilith.)

Though Arthur was eager to recover Gawaine, that would have to wait, for his forces were to sail for Ireland to aid King Anguish. Matilda joined the core of Earl Robert's knights in leading the forces near Tara. They were victorious against a combined force of Picts and Irish.

After the battles Axel, Elgan, Lilith, and Matilda searched for Arthur's kin, Gawaine, and found him in the Land Beyond the Mountains where he had been having a grand time and married King Joran's daughter.
