## Year 519 - Chapter XXXVIII - The Battle of Alcuid
![Britain_519][image-2]
The year of our Lord 519 saw rebellion in Anglia and a combined Pict and Irish invasion in Alcuid. Arthur marched north to Alcuid to deal with an invasion to his realm while Duke Hervis relentlessly clamped down on the rebellion. News from France told a sad tale of the conquest of Ganis, with no lords or heirs surviving.

The veteran knights Calliope and Heckle accompanied Arthur, along with the younger knights Axel and Elcard. There they helped break the siege of Alcuid and pursued the attacking Picts back to their own land, retreating to the islands of Loch Lomond. A Christian monk persuaded Arthur to have mercy so he could convert the pagan Picts and so redeem their heathen souls.

## Year 520 - Chapter XXXVIX - Building Camelot
After years of warfare, Calliope and Heckle took advantage of the opportunity for a summer spent garrisoned at the building site for Arthur's capital at the abandoned Caer Gwent, to be renamed Calemot, accompanied by the younger knights Elgan and Axel. Duke Hervis spent the summer brutally putting down a rebellion, resulting in the deaths of many loyal subjects of Arthur.

The summer, though not deadly, was a strange one. The knights met the talking eagle, Eliwod, bearing a warning for King Arthur that pride was the fault of the Pendragons. Taking Arthur to the bird, it repeated its warning, revealing it was once a human, the bastard son of Prince Madoc.

Near Caer Gwent a minor lord patrolled his land, challenging all knights to joust, taking their beards as forfeit. Though a bizarre custom, it could not be allowed to persist and embarrass Arthur. The knights took the initiative and defeated the lord and his knights in jousting, sending them away.

However, one of the vanquished knights was slain in a nearby marsh by a giant bird, a boobrie, possessing a hellish shriek that terrified man and beast alike and vicious talons and beak. They slew the foul beast, helping secure Arthur's land.
