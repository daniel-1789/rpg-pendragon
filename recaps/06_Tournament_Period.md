## Year 540 - Chapter LIX - The Hunt for Cerridwen
The knights Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda spent much of the winter and sprint recruiting aid in the hunt for Cerridwen. Axel's cousin Tink, a fey knight and son of  Uncle Maul, accompanied them. Sir Borre, husband of Matilda and bastard son of Arthur, joined in the hunt. Sir Gawaine, always eager for adventure, joined them. And Sir Romulus, cousin to Lilith, son of her Uncle Remus, joined them.

Sir Elidir conferred with Nimue, Lady of the Lake and Enchantress, who provided them with enahcnatments to aid them in the battle. She gave Elidir and enchanted boar spear and all of them an oil that would protect their shields and armor from the acid the boar emitted.

Pursuing the boar into a canyon, the battle was brutal. Larger than an elephant, Tink, Borre, and Romulus fell before they were able to fell the vile beast.

Returning to Camelot in glory but with the grim news that Arthur's son had fallen, they discovered Arthur himself had gone missing...

## Year 541 - Chapter LX - Rescuing Arthur
In early spring of 541, Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda joined in the search for the missing king. During their search they came across a group of hyenas, nasty enchanted blasted that tried to trick them. Making short work of them, they soon were taking the enchantress Nimue back to the location of the battle, and there she used her sight to track the hyenas back to a castle, one they had been sent from.

The castle belonged to the enchantress Annowre, who had used magic to capture King Arthur. Our heroic knights defeated her knights, captured her, and restored the king.

## Year 542 - Chapter LXI - Le Chevalier sans Mémoire

En route to a tournament the knights Axel, Eledir, Lilith, and Matilda encountered a stranger who had lost his memory - but swore he was a knight. He told them all he remembered was he had important business and had been ambushed by the Giant Black Dwarf.

They visited the home of the Giant Black Dwarf and his wife, the Dwarf White Giantess. Challenging him to a duel, he eventually yielded and told them he was a servant of the Queen of the Out Isles and defeated the knight on her orders and distributed his weapons and armor. To regain his memory he would need the gear back.

His sword was held by the Knight of the Bright Sword who cheerfully agreed to part with it if one of them could defeat him in a duel to the death. Axel did so, with the knight never asking for quarter.

His shield was held by a fearsome giant, one they defeated though some suffered grievous wounds.

His armor was held by a wyrm. Sir Eledir lent his wyrmslaying sword to their best sword wielder, Lilith. The Wyrm too did great harm and while they could not slay it, they drove it off and retrieved the armor.

With his gear returned the knight remembered he was Sir Edar, a pagan knight. He had to save Sir Ozana from an assassination sent by his former paramour, the Queen of the Out Isles. Sir Edar died in the effort but the knights gained the gratitude of their fellow Round Table knight, Sir Ozana - and the enmity to the Queen of the Out Isles. He presented to them Sir Edar's gear as thanks.

## Year 543 - Chapter LXII - Castle of the Hard Rock Tournament

At the tournament held at the Castle of the Hard Rock, Elidir won glory at winning the jousting tournament, defeating Sir Gawain in the final tilt - and accidentally wounded him, causing him to bow out of the melee.

In the grand melee a strange black knight was triumphant but refused Arthur’s invitation to join him upon the dais. Lancelot perused him to demand he show proper respect. In the grand battle which followed they learned the black knight was Sir Tristam, banished by his liege, King Mark of Cornwall. All was forgiven and a group of knights, against the advice cooler heads like Elidir and Matilda, rode off to harry King Mark.

The Lady Lilith, feeling her years, decided to sit out the tournament this time. She found herself being approached by knights preaching strange ideas that rulership should depend on the consent of the governed. Investigating she discovered he was a knight of the late King Lot, father of Gawain and husband of Arthur’s half-sister. But further investigation showed the knight was also an associate of Sir Mordred.

## Year 544 - Chapter LXIII - The Capture of King Mark

The knights of Earl Robert patrolled the Cornish border, for it was rumored King Mark was sending raiders to avenge the slights against him last year. They were more fortunate than they could have imagined, capturing King Mark and his knights at a church crossroads.

At Camelot, King Mark was King Arthur's "guest" and swore fealty to Arthur at a "friendship tournament". There was some tension when the Orkneys - the sons of the late King Lot - Mordred, Gaheris, Agravaine, and Gawaine, got into a conflict with Sir Lamorak de Galles whose father, King Pellinore, slew King Lot. 

Sir Lamorak left early, as did Sir Gaheris. While violence between them was feared, in the end it transpired that someone murdered Queen Margawse, widow of King Lot and half-sister of King Arthur...

## Year 545 - Chapter LXIX - The Capture of King Mark
The knights who captured King Mark participated in making sure their share of the ransom found its way to them. However, the train carrying the gear briefly found itself in the land of the Faerie and they were accosted by giants and a faerie knight. Though they made short work of the giants, the faerie knight did slay Lilith before being finally defeated by her companions. 

That winter, Lilith's son Sir Desmond was knighted and married to Sir Gawaine's eldest daughter, the Lady Bela, who had been taught in the ways of knighthood by her late mother-in-law. She too was knighted and presented with Lilith's Red Sword.

Also at the end of the year feasting did a strange Green Knight arrive at Camelot with a mystical challenge - he would take any blow from one of Arthur's Knights and one year hence, at the Green Chapel, would the Green Knight return the blow. Gawaine did so, severing the knight's head. Who grasped his decapitated head, bowed, and said he would see Gawaine one year hence.

## Year 546 - Chapter LXX- Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

Axel, Elidir, and Matilda were joined by Bela, daughter of Gawain and daughter-in-law of the late Lilith. For their first journey they accompanied Gawain as he searched for the Green Chapel.

They were often separated from Gawain, who went off to look for leads. During on of those times they slew the Nunnington Dragon, chasing it into a giant hollowed out tree - and aided by the Hound of Sool who prevented it from regenerating as it sought to.

The journey lasted long, with Elidir eager to return home to his manor and husband. However, they were forced to spend Christmas at a lord’s castle who told them the chapel was but hours away. The lord went hunting during the day, promising Gawain whatever he caught and asking Gawain that he in return give him anything he gain in the castle. This had the potential to get awkward with the lord’s wife nearly throwing herself at Gawain but Gawain stayed true. However, she also gave him a sash which would protect him from the Green Knight, something he did not give to the lord - with his companions unable to tell him the proper honorable course of action.

The sash did protect Sir Gawain, though at a loss of honor, for the Green Knight was the very lord whose castle they had stayed at. And they learned the Green Knight had been enchanted by none other than Morgan Le Fay - who had been in disguise as an old serving woman at the lord’s castle.

## Year 547 - Chapter LXXI- The Goblin Market
The Lady Elaine arrived in Camelot with a young son, Galahad, who looked remarkably like Lancelot. Oddly she looked a bit like the Queen… This caused quite the row between Lancelot and the Queen who banished him.

The four knights adventured into the wasteland, with Elidir having heard rumor that King Cawdy's daughter had been inflicted by aging similar to what Arthur seemed to be suffering from. 

King Cawdy's daughter, Alene, though barely into her adulthood, appeared ancient. Her maid explained it was from eating fruits from the Goblin Market. The four sought out such a market, running into a storyteller peasant named Robin who showed them the way. After quite the scuffle with goblins they learned the goblins had indeed taken Alene’s soul, causing her aging - and had sold her soul in the Fair of the Woods to a red-eyed merchant. 

At the mysterious fair they answered the fair master’s riddle and were admitted. They eventually found the red-eyed merchant who confirmed he did indeed have the Princess Alene’s soul - and he would be prepared to trade it for a circlet. He also had a clock with a knight, Sir Tegvan, as part of it. He indicated he was willing to negotiate for that as well.

Focusing on the Circlet first they braved a trial of fire but then the mighty elf knight master of the Fair, Sir Vesper, challenged them to battle. Lady Matilda fell, mortally wounded, as did Elidir, though less grievously wounded.  Eventually they defeated him and agreed to a life for a life, restoring Matilda to health - though perhaps a little…. Different.

The red-eyed merchant exchanged the circlet for Alene’s soul, and in so doing revealed himself to be both the storyteller Robin and the faerie Puck. He tried wearing the circlet but melted away…. Dead? Probably not. Sir Vesper offered them the contents of the clock in return for one service approved by their liege lord. Agreeing he opened it, releasing Sir Tegvan - and the Saxon Caelin, son of Cynric, grandson of King Cerdic - he too had fallen into the fey trap. They took Caelin to Arthur where he would be ransomed back to his family. A grateful King Cawdy offered the hand of his daughter in marriage to Sir Axel’s eldest son.
