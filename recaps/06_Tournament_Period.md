## Year 540 - Chapter LIX - The Hunt for Cerridwen 
The knights Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda spent much of the winter and sprint recruiting aid in the hunt for Cerridwen. Axel's cousin Tink, a fey knight and son of  Uncle Maul, accompanied them. Sir Borre, husband of Matilda and bastard son of Arthur, joined in the hunt. Sir Gawaine, always eager for adventure, joined them. And Sir Romulus, cousin to Lilith, son of her Uncle Remus, joined them.

Sir Elidir conferred with Nimue, Lady of the Lake and Enchantress, who provided them with enahcnatments to aid them in the battle. She gave Elidir and enchanted boar spear and all of them an oil that would protect their shields and armor from the acid the boar emitted.

Pursuing the boar into a canyon, the battle was brutal. Larger than an elephant, Tink, Borre, and Romulus fell before they were able to fell the vile beast.

Returning to Camelot in glory but with the grim news that Arthur's son had fallen, they discovered Arthur himself had gone missing...

## Year 541 - Chapter LX - Rescuing Arthur
In early spring of 541, Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda joined in the search for the missing king. During their search they came across a group of hyenas, nasty enchanted blasted that tried to trick them. Making short work of them, they soon were taking the enchantress Nimue back to the location of the battle, and there she used her sight to track the hyenas back to a castle, one they had been sent from.

The castle belonged to the enchantress Annowre, who had used magic to capture King Arthur. Our heroic knights defeated her knights, captured her, and restored the king.
