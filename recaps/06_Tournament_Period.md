## Year 540 - Chapter LIX - The Hunt for Cerridwen 
The knights Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda spent much of the winter and sprint recruiting aid in the hunt for Cerridwen. Axel's cousin Tink, a fey knight and son of  Uncle Maul, accompanied them. Sir Borre, husband of Matilda and bastard son of Arthur, joined in the hunt. Sir Gawaine, always eager for adventure, joined them. And Sir Romulus, cousin to Lilith, son of her Uncle Remus, joined them.

Sir Elidir conferred with Nimue, Lady of the Lake and Enchantress, who provided them with enahcnatments to aid them in the battle. She gave Elidir and enchanted boar spear and all of them an oil that would protect their shields and armor from the acid the boar emitted.

Pursuing the boar into a canyon, the battle was brutal. Larger than an elephant, Tink, Borre, and Romulus fell before they were able to fell the vile beast.

Returning to Camelot in glory but with the grim news that Arthur's son had fallen, they discovered Arthur himself had gone missing...

## Year 541 - Chapter LX - Rescuing Arthur
In early spring of 541, Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda joined in the search for the missing king. During their search they came across a group of hyenas, nasty enchanted blasted that tried to trick them. Making short work of them, they soon were taking the enchantress Nimue back to the location of the battle, and there she used her sight to track the hyenas back to a castle, one they had been sent from.

The castle belonged to the enchantress Annowre, who had used magic to capture King Arthur. Our heroic knights defeated her knights, captured her, and restored the king.

## Year 542 - Chapter LXI - Le Chevalier sans Mémoire

En route to a tournament the knights Axel, Eledir, Lilith, and Matilda encountered a stranger who had lost his memory - but swore he was a knight. He told them all he remembered was he had important business and had been ambushed by the Giant Black Dwarf.

They visited the home of the Giant Black Dwarf and his wife, the Dwarf White Giantess. Challenging him to a duel, he eventually yielded and told them he was a servant of the Queen of the Out Isles and defeated the knight on her orders and distributed his weapons and armor. To regain his memory he would need the gear back.

His sword was held by the Knight of the Bright Sword who cheerfully agreed to part with it if one of them could defeat him in a duel to the death. Axel did so, with the knight never asking for quarter.

His shield was held by a fearsome giant, one they defeated though some suffered grievous wounds.

His armor was held by a wyrm. Sir Eledir lent his wyrmslaying sword to their best sword wielder, Lilith. The Wyrm too did great harm and while they could not slay it, they drove it off and retrieved the armor.

With his gear returned the knight remembered he was Sir Edar, a pagan knight. He had to save Sir Ozana from an assassination sent by his former paramour, the Queen of the Out Isles. Sir Edar died in the effort but the knights gained the gratitude of their fellow Round Table knight, Sir Ozana - and the enmity to the Queen of the Out Isles. He presented to them Sir Edar's gear as thanks.

## Year 543 - Chapter LXII - Castle of the Hard Rock Tournament

At the tournament held at the Castle of the Hard Rock, Elidir won glory at winning the jousting tournament, defeating Sir Gawain in the final tilt - and accidentally wounded him, causing him to bow out of the melee.

In the grand melee a strange black knight was triumphant but refused Arthur’s invitation to join him upon the dais. Lancelot perused him to demand he show proper respect. In the grand battle which followed they learned the black knight was Sir Tristam, banished by his liege, King Mark of Cornwall. All was forgiven and a group of knights, against the advice cooler heads like Elidir and Matilda, rode off to harry King Mark.

The Lady Lilith, feeling her years, decided to sit out the tournament this time. She found herself being approached by knights preaching strange ideas that rulership should depend on the consent of the governed. Investigating she discovered he was a knight of the late King Lot, father of Gawain and husband of Arthur’s half-sister. But further investigation showed the knight was also an associate of Sir Mordred.

## Year 544 - Chapter LXIII - The Capture of King Mark

The knights of Earl Robert patrolled the Cornish border, for it was rumored King Mark was sending raiders to avenge the slights against him last year. They were more fortunate than they could have imagined, capturing King Mark and his knights at a church crossroads.

At Camelot, King Mark was King Arthur's "guest" and swore fealty to Arthur at a "friendship tournament". There was some tension when the Orkneys - the sons of the late King Lot - Mordred, Gaheris, Agravaine, and Gawaine, got into a conflict with Sir Lamorak de Galles whose father, King Pellinore, slew King Lot. 

Sir Lamorak left early, as did Sir Gaheris. While violence between them was feared, in the end it transpired that someone murdered Queen Margawse, widow of King Lot and half-sister of King Arthur...s
