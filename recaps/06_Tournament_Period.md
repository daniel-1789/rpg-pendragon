## Year 540 - Chapter LIX - The Hunt for Cerridwen
The knights Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda spent much of the winter and sprint recruiting aid in the hunt for Cerridwen. Axel's cousin Tink, a fey knight and son of  Uncle Maul, accompanied them. Sir Borre, husband of Matilda and bastard son of Arthur, joined in the hunt. Sir Gawaine, always eager for adventure, joined them. And Sir Romulus, cousin to Lilith, son of her Uncle Remus, joined them.

Sir Elidir conferred with Nimue, Lady of the Lake and Enchantress, who provided them with enahcnatments to aid them in the battle. She gave Elidir and enchanted boar spear and all of them an oil that would protect their shields and armor from the acid the boar emitted.

Pursuing the boar into a canyon, the battle was brutal. Larger than an elephant, Tink, Borre, and Romulus fell before they were able to fell the vile beast.

Returning to Camelot in glory but with the grim news that Arthur's son had fallen, they discovered Arthur himself had gone missing...

## Year 541 - Chapter LX - Rescuing Arthur
In early spring of 541, Axel, Elixir, Lilith, and Matilda joined in the search for the missing king. During their search they came across a group of hyenas, nasty enchanted blasted that tried to trick them. Making short work of them, they soon were taking the enchantress Nimue back to the location of the battle, and there she used her sight to track the hyenas back to a castle, one they had been sent from.

The castle belonged to the enchantress Annowre, who had used magic to capture King Arthur. Our heroic knights defeated her knights, captured her, and restored the king.

## Year 542 - Chapter LXI - Le Chevalier sans Mémoire

En route to a tournament the knights Axel, Eledir, Lilith, and Matilda encountered a stranger who had lost his memory - but swore he was a knight. He told them all he remembered was he had important business and had been ambushed by the Giant Black Dwarf.

They visited the home of the Giant Black Dwarf and his wife, the Dwarf White Giantess. Challenging him to a duel, he eventually yielded and told them he was a servant of the Queen of the Out Isles and defeated the knight on her orders and distributed his weapons and armor. To regain his memory he would need the gear back.

His sword was held by the Knight of the Bright Sword who cheerfully agreed to part with it if one of them could defeat him in a duel to the death. Axel did so, with the knight never asking for quarter.

His shield was held by a fearsome giant, one they defeated though some suffered grievous wounds.

His armor was held by a wyrm. Sir Eledir lent his wyrmslaying sword to their best sword wielder, Lilith. The Wyrm too did great harm and while they could not slay it, they drove it off and retrieved the armor.

With his gear returned the knight remembered he was Sir Edar, a pagan knight. He had to save Sir Ozana from an assassination sent by his former paramour, the Queen of the Out Isles. Sir Edar died in the effort but the knights gained the gratitude of their fellow Round Table knight, Sir Ozana - and the enmity to the Queen of the Out Isles. He presented to them Sir Edar's gear as thanks.

## Year 543 - Chapter LXII - Castle of the Hard Rock Tournament

At the tournament held at the Castle of the Hard Rock, Elidir won glory at winning the jousting tournament, defeating Sir Gawain in the final tilt - and accidentally wounded him, causing him to bow out of the melee.

In the grand melee a strange black knight was triumphant but refused Arthur’s invitation to join him upon the dais. Lancelot perused him to demand he show proper respect. In the grand battle which followed they learned the black knight was Sir Tristam, banished by his liege, King Mark of Cornwall. All was forgiven and a group of knights, against the advice cooler heads like Elidir and Matilda, rode off to harry King Mark.

The Lady Lilith, feeling her years, decided to sit out the tournament this time. She found herself being approached by knights preaching strange ideas that rulership should depend on the consent of the governed. Investigating she discovered he was a knight of the late King Lot, father of Gawain and husband of Arthur’s half-sister. But further investigation showed the knight was also an associate of Sir Mordred.

## Year 544 - Chapter LXIII - The Capture of King Mark

The knights of Earl Robert patrolled the Cornish border, for it was rumored King Mark was sending raiders to avenge the slights against him last year. They were more fortunate than they could have imagined, capturing King Mark and his knights at a church crossroads.

At Camelot, King Mark was King Arthur's "guest" and swore fealty to Arthur at a "friendship tournament". There was some tension when the Orkneys - the sons of the late King Lot - Mordred, Gaheris, Agravaine, and Gawaine, got into a conflict with Sir Lamorak de Galles whose father, King Pellinore, slew King Lot. 

Sir Lamorak left early, as did Sir Gaheris. While violence between them was feared, in the end it transpired that someone murdered Queen Margawse, widow of King Lot and half-sister of King Arthur...

## Year 545 - Chapter LXIX - The Capture of King Mark
The knights who captured King Mark participated in making sure their share of the ransom found its way to them. However, the train carrying the gear briefly found itself in the land of the Faerie and they were accosted by giants and a faerie knight. Though they made short work of the giants, the faerie knight did slay Lilith before being finally defeated by her companions. 

That winter, Lilith's son Sir Desmond was knighted and married to Sir Gawaine's eldest daughter, the Lady Bela, who had been taught in the ways of knighthood by her late mother-in-law. She too was knighted and presented with Lilith's Red Sword.

Also at the end of the year feasting did a strange Green Knight arrive at Camelot with a mystical challenge - he would take any blow from one of Arthur's Knights and one year hence, at the Green Chapel, would the Green Knight return the blow. Gawaine did so, severing the knight's head. Who grasped his decapitated head, bowed, and said he would see Gawaine one year hence.

## Year 546 - Chapter LXX- Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

Axel, Elidir, and Matilda were joined by Bela, daughter of Gawain and daughter-in-law of the late Lilith. For their first journey they accompanied Gawain as he searched for the Green Chapel.

They were often separated from Gawain, who went off to look for leads. During on of those times they slew the Nunnington Dragon, chasing it into a giant hollowed out tree - and aided by the Hound of Sool who prevented it from regenerating as it sought to.

The journey lasted long, with Elidir eager to return home to his manor and husband. However, they were forced to spend Christmas at a lord’s castle who told them the chapel was but hours away. The lord went hunting during the day, promising Gawain whatever he caught and asking Gawain that he in return give him anything he gain in the castle. This had the potential to get awkward with the lord’s wife nearly throwing herself at Gawain but Gawain stayed true. However, she also gave him a sash which would protect him from the Green Knight, something he did not give to the lord - with his companions unable to tell him the proper honorable course of action.

The sash did protect Sir Gawain, though at a loss of honor, for the Green Knight was the very lord whose castle they had stayed at. And they learned the Green Knight had been enchanted by none other than Morgan Le Fay - who had been in disguise as an old serving woman at the lord’s castle.

## Year 547 - Chapter LXXI- The Goblin Market
The Lady Elaine arrived in Camelot with a young son, Galahad, who looked remarkably like Lancelot. Oddly she looked a bit like the Queen… This caused quite the row between Lancelot and the Queen who banished him.

The four knights adventured into the wasteland, with Elidir having heard rumor that King Cawdy's daughter had been inflicted by aging similar to what Arthur seemed to be suffering from. 

King Cawdy's daughter, Alene, though barely into her adulthood, appeared ancient. Her maid explained it was from eating fruits from the Goblin Market. The four sought out such a market, running into a storyteller peasant named Robin who showed them the way. After quite the scuffle with goblins they learned the goblins had indeed taken Alene’s soul, causing her aging - and had sold her soul in the Fair of the Woods to a red-eyed merchant. 

At the mysterious fair they answered the fair master’s riddle and were admitted. They eventually found the red-eyed merchant who confirmed he did indeed have the Princess Alene’s soul - and he would be prepared to trade it for a circlet. He also had a clock with a knight, Sir Tegvan, as part of it. He indicated he was willing to negotiate for that as well.

Focusing on the Circlet first they braved a trial of fire but then the mighty elf knight master of the Fair, Sir Vesper, challenged them to battle. Lady Matilda fell, mortally wounded, as did Elidir, though less grievously wounded.  Eventually they defeated him and agreed to a life for a life, restoring Matilda to health - though perhaps a little…. Different.

The red-eyed merchant exchanged the circlet for Alene’s soul, and in so doing revealed himself to be both the storyteller Robin and the faerie Puck. He tried wearing the circlet but melted away…. Dead? Probably not. Sir Vesper offered them the contents of the clock in return for one service approved by their liege lord. Agreeing he opened it, releasing Sir Tegvan - and the Saxon Caelin, son of Cynric, grandson of King Cerdic - he too had fallen into the fey trap. They took Caelin to Arthur where he would be ransomed back to his family. A grateful King Cawdy offered the hand of his daughter in marriage to Sir Axel’s eldest son.

## Year 548 - Chapter LXXII- The Saurum Tournament
Before departing for Camelot, Axel’s son Maug married Alene and Elidir’s son Lewys was knighted and wed. Their time at Camelot was to brief, as Earl Robert needed their aid with a late summer tournament. However, it was revealed it was by his ability to open an enchanted egg that it was Sir Kay, foster brother of Arthur, who had slain his sole remaining bastard son, Loholt, during a quest to slay a giant. Before more could be revealed Kay fled from court. After a funeral Axel, Lewys, Bela, and Matilda returned to Saurum for Earl Robert’s tournament.

The tournament had a variety of guests, including the Saxon Caelin, awaiting his ransom home, and Sir Zephyr of the Fae. The joust was unusually brutal with Matilda holding a grudge against Caelin and his family, the two of them greatly injuring each other. Lewys jousted against Zephyr, seeking vengeance for Zephyr’s wounds against his father, who had retired from active adventure as a result of them. In the end it was Zephyr who won the joust but Bela, daughter of Gawain and daughter-in-law of Lilith, was champion of the melee.

## Year 549 - Chapter LXXIII- The King’s Justice

That winter Bela had investigated the disappearance of Sir Kay. Not only had he fled, he had apparently stolen away with Excalibur. Kay had apparently traveled beyond the faerie vail in search of sanctuary. Axel, Bela, Lewis, and Matilda traveled to the land of King Cawdy, father-in-law to Axel’s son, Maug II. There they knew there were passages to the Faerie. They learned from Robin Goodfellow (apparently not quite dead) Kay had indeed passed but knew little more. 

In an audience before King Oberon and Queen Titania the four parleyed. The two were loath to provide assistance or grant safe passage without a price being paid. In the end Sir Axel, feeling his 30 years of knighthood agreed to their terms - he would stay and serve the faerie court after they achieved their mission.

They then learned that he had traveled to the underlie court and had exchanged Excalibur for the protection of Duke Kingsor. Back in 515 their forebears Calliope, Heckle, Leofric, and Maul battled Kingsor to protect Castle Joy. In addition to protecting Sir Kay, Queen Maeve was staying at Kingsor’s castle. 

After much parley they convinced Kingsor the sword had been stolen and it was not Kay’s to give. Kay demanded the right to prove himself by battle - leading to Axel making short work of Kay, decapitating him in one blow. 
  
Axel kept his word and remained in faerie, presenting his enchanted axe to be given to his son. The remainder then presented Excalibur and the head of Kay to King Arthur.

## Year 550 - Chapter LXXIV- Stone House Visit

Maug II, son of Axel and grandson of Maug, joined with the knights Bela, Lewis, and Matilda for an adventure in Cornwall. They had learned, from Sir Tristam, a young widow, Laid Melia, was being kept a prisoner by her former brother-in-to keep income from her lands. 

As they journeyed in Cornwall they passed ruins - as if a great explosion scooped a hole in the Earth, perhaps five years prior. They saw remains of strange yellow and red symbols on some ruined wood and stone. Local peasants told them this was the work of the Squire Priest, a sorcerer working for King Mark - he apparently accidentally destroyed an entire village here. 

They reached the manor of the Knight of Stone where Lady Melia was imprisoned. While they parleyed the lady herself bolted out, with the four knights covering her as Lady Matilda helped her ride off. 

As they escaped, Melia asked them for a firepot as there was something they had to see. Giving her one - and providing her with her own horse, they followed her to a Cornish village with slaves laboring at a stone building with the same yellow and red symbols they had seen before. Covering her and battling Cornish warriors, they watched the building immediately go ablaze as she tossed the firepot onto its roof. They quickly fled as the stone building was engulfed in fire. She told them this was why she had been imprisoned, as she had been learning of King Mark’s sponsorship of the Squire Priest to possibly build a weapon against King Arthur.

However, the destruction brought attention and they had to fight their way out of Cornwall. Banneret Cesar Stone led a troop of knights against them. Though they protected their charge, Matilda fell in the effort, mortally wounded by Stone. Bela drove Stone off his horse, possibly slaying him in the process, though they had no time to confirm, as their need to escape Cornwall and report to King Arthur was great.

## Year 551 - Chapter LXXV- The Tournament of OverThere

Shortly after midsummer, Arthur summoned all of his knights who were at Camelot to assemble in the night. The aged and inform king told them that King Today had invited Arthur and his knights to a tournament. The Lady Nimue explained some basic rules - since they had been invited they could partake of food and other gifts so long as they were appropriate to the knight’s station. 

Crossing over they found themselves in the sunlit realms of the faerie. Before the tournament took place, Arthur held court. A remarkable thing took place, with Sir Mordred claiming to be Arthur’s son through his mother Margawse, the king’s half-sister. Mordred claimed when Lancelot returned all would be confirmed.

In the tournament itself, Sir John accounted well for himself, defeating Sir Axel, now of the faerie in his first tilt. In his second he defeated on of Lilith’s sons. He was victorious against the dwarf Gimli but in the fourth tilt he saw Arthur was his next opponent. Not wishing to unhorse his king he chose th lose with dignity. However Sir Mordred had no such hesitance, unhorsing his purported father, and won the joust. 

Within the melee, Maug, Lewys, and John fought well, defeating Axel and Zephyr in battle. At the melee’s end John was named champion.

While her companions fought, Bela explored the faerie lands - the lake, the city, and castle. She spoke with King Today, telling him tales of their adventures. In return, the King promised her a favor. She also encountered a hag who prophesied:
> The kingdom shall fall when father battles son and son battles father, chance of peace ended by treasonous serpent. 
Finally she saw great boats of the faerie and learned some of their craft.

The knights returned to Camelot, despite King Today’s offer they could stay. That winter, at long last, Lancelot returned to court and released from an oath of secrecy, confirmed Mordred’s parentage as a priest had told them years previous.

## Year 552 - Chapter LXXVI- The War Against Duke Klingsor

Sir Zephyr informed the knights that King Today of the faerie needed their aid and he was calling in the favor the knights owed Sir Zephyr.

As they crossed into the Faerie Lands, they found that Cleopolis, city of King Today, Oberon, was soon to be attacked by the forces of Queen Maeve, allied with the demonic Duke Klingsor - rumor had it he even controlled her. If Maeve’s unseelie forces triumphed, all balance would be lost, with the seelie becoming more like the unseelie and the unseelie becoming as if demons. They saw many knights had joined in this Great War, including Mordred, bastard son of Arthur.

Sir Axel of the Faerie arranged the forces, with the main force being aligned against the unseelie horde. However, a second squad, led by Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug stayed in reserve, waiting their moment to attack the demonic forces of Klingsor. When their chance arose they waded through rank upon rank of forces of hell. Sir John was unhorsed and nearly slain, recovering only due to his great injuries being treated by Lady Bela. In battle with Klingsor she too fell, greatly wounded, with the wicked duke finally slain by Sir Lewys and Maug.

## Year 553 - Chapter LXXVII - Raiding King Mark

King Mark continued to hold back his tribute to Arthur while the rapidly aging king doddered and the blight affected most of the kingdom.

Bela, John, Lewys, and Maug led a raiding party into Cornwall to take part of the tribute by force. Though they were successful, they found themselves facing a strange fire-spewing mechanical device - not quite completed, but clearly Mark was planning something amiss…
